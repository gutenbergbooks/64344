<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the life of every individual
who has, for any reason, attracted extensively
the attention of mankind, has been written in
a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors,
and persons sometimes wonder why we
should have so many different accounts of the
same thing. The reason is, that each one of
these accounts is intended for a different set of
readers, who read with ideas and purposes widely
dissimilar from each other. Among the
twenty millions of people in the United States,
there are perhaps two millions, between the ages
of fifteen and twenty-five, who wish to become
acquainted, in general, with the leading events
in the history of the Old World, and of ancient
times, but who, coming upon the stage in this
land and at this period, have ideas and conceptions
so widely different from those of other nations
and of other times, that a mere republication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
existing accounts is not what they require.
The story must be told expressly for
them. The things that are to be explained,
the points that are to be brought out, the comparative
degree of prominence to be given to
the various particulars, will all be different, on
account of the difference in the situation, the
ideas, and the objects of these new readers,
compared with those of the various other classes
of readers which former authors have had in
view. It is for this reason, and with this view,
that the present series of historical narratives is
presented to the public. The author, having
had some opportunity to become acquainted
with the position, the ideas, and the intellectual
wants of those whom he addresses, presents
the result of his labors to them, with the hope
that it may be found successful in accomplishing
its design.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">K</span>ING CHARLES the first was born
in Scotland. It may perhaps surprise
the reader that an English king should be born
in Scotland. The explanation is this:</p>

<div class="sidenote">1600.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Born in Scotland.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The circumstance explained</div>

<p>They who have read the history of Mary
Queen of Scots, will remember that it was the
great end and aim of her life to unite the
crowns of England and Scotland in her own
family. Queen Elizabeth was then Queen
of England. She lived and died unmarried.
Queen Mary and a young man named Lord
Darnley were the next heirs. It was uncertain
which of the two had the strongest claim.
To prevent a dispute, by uniting these claims,
Mary made Darnley her husband. They had
a son, who, after the death of his father and
mother, was acknowledged to be the heir to
the English throne, whenever Elizabeth's life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>should end. In the mean time he remained
King of Scotland. His name was James. He
married a princess of Denmark; and his child,
who afterward was King Charles the First of
England, was born before he left his native
realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Princess Anne.</div>

<p>King Charles's mother was, as has been already
said, a princess of Denmark. Her name
was Anne. The circumstances of her marriage
to King James were quite extraordinary,
and attracted great attention at the time. It
is, in some sense, a matter of principle among
kings and queens, that they must only marry
persons of royal rank, like themselves; and as
they have very little opportunity of visiting each
other, residing as they do in such distant capitals,
they generally choose their consorts by the
reports which come to them of the person and
character of the different candidates. The
choice, too, is very much influenced by political
considerations, and is always more or less
embarrassed by the interference of other courts,
whose ministers make objections to this or that
alliance, on account of its supposed interference
with some of their own political schemes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Royal marriages.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Getting married by proxy.</div>

<p>As it is very inconvenient, moreover, for a
king to leave his dominions, the marriage ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is usually performed at the court where
the bride resides, without the presence of the
bridegroom, he sending an embassador to act
as his representative. This is called being
married by proxy. The bride then comes to
her royal husband's dominions, accompanied by
a great escort. He meets her usually on the
frontiers; and there she sees him for the first
time, after having been married to him some
weeks by proxy. It is true, indeed, that she
has generally seen his <em>picture</em>, that being usually
sent to her before the marriage contract is
made. This, however, is not a matter of much
consequence, as the personal predilections of a
princess have generally very little to do with
the question of her marriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James thwarted.</div>

<div class="sidenote">James sues for Anne.</div>

<p>Now King James had concluded to propose
for the oldest daughter of the King of Denmark,
and he entered into negotiations for this purpose.
This plan, however, did not please the
government of England, and Elizabeth, who
was then the English queen, managed so to
embarrass and interfere with the scheme, that
the King of Denmark gave his daughter to
another claimant. James was a man of very
mild and quiet temperament, easily counteracted
and thwarted in his plans; but this disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>aroused his energies, and he sent
a splendid embassy into Denmark to demand
the king's second daughter, whose name was
Anne. He prosecuted this suit so vigorously
that the marriage articles were soon agreed to
and signed. Anne embarked and set sail for
Scotland. The king remained there, waiting
for her arrival with great impatience. At
length, instead of his bride, the news came that
the fleet in which Anne had sailed had been
dispersed and driven back by a storm, and that
Anne herself had landed on the coast of Norway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their marriage.</div>

<div class="sidenote">James in Copenhagen.</div>

<p>James immediately conceived the design of
going himself in pursuit of her. But knowing
very well that all his ministers and the officers
of his government would make endless objections
to his going out of the country on such
an errand, he kept his plan a profound secret
from them all. He ordered some ships to be
got ready privately, and provided a suitable
train of attendants, and then embarked without
letting his people know where he was going.
He sailed across the German Ocean to the
town in Norway where his bride had landed.
He found her there, and they were married.
Her brother, who had just succeeded to the
throne, having received intelligence of this, invited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the young couple to come and spend the
winter at his capital of Copenhagen; and as
the season was far advanced, and the sea
stormy, King James concluded to accept the
invitation. They were received in Copenhagen
with great pomp and parade, and the winter
was spent in festivities and rejoicings. In the
spring he brought his bride to Scotland. The
whole world were astonished at the performance
of such an exploit by a king, especially
one of so mild, quiet, and grave a character as
that which James had the credit of possessing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles's feeble infancy.</div>

<p>Young Charles was very weak and feeble in
his infancy. It was feared that he would not
live many hours. The rite of baptism was immediately
performed, as it was, in those days,
considered essential to the salvation of a child
dying in infancy that it should be baptized before
it died. Notwithstanding the fears that
were at first felt, Charles lingered along for
some days, and gradually began to acquire a
little strength. His feebleness was a cause of
great anxiety and concern to those around him;
but the degree of interest felt in the little sufferer's
fate was very much less than it would
have been if he had been the oldest son. He
had a brother, Prince Henry, who was older
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>than he, and, consequently, heir to his father's
crowns. It was not probable, therefore, that
Charles would ever be king; and the importance
of every thing connected with his birth
and his welfare was very much diminished on
that account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Elizabeth.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Accession of James to the English crown.</div>

<p>It was only about two years after Charles's
birth that Queen Elizabeth died, and King
James succeeded to the English throne. A
messenger came with all speed to Scotland to
announce the fact. He rode night and day.
He arrived at the king's palace in the night.
He gained admission to the king's chamber,
and, kneeling at his bedside, proclaimed him
King of England. James immediately prepared
to bid his Scotch subjects farewell, and
to proceed to England to take possession of his
new realm. Queen Anne was to follow him
in a week or two, and the other children, Henry
and Elizabeth; but Charles was too feeble to go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1603.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Second sight.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Prediction fulfilled.</div>

<p>In those early days there was a prevailing
belief in Scotland, and, in fact, the opinion still
lingers there, that certain persons among the
old Highlanders had what they called the gift
of the second sight&mdash;that is, the power of foreseeing
futurity in some mysterious and incomprehensible
way. An incident is related in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>old histories connected with Charles's infancy,
which is a good illustration of this. While
King James was preparing to leave Scotland,
to take possession of the English throne, an old
Highland laird came to bid him farewell. He
gave the king many parting counsels and good
wishes, and then, overlooking the older brother,
Prince Henry, he went directly to Charles, who
was then about two years old, and bowed before
him, and kissed his hand with the greatest
appearance of regard and veneration. King
James undertook to correct his supposed mistake,
by telling him that that was his second
son, and that the other boy was the heir to the
crown. "No," said the old laird, "I am not
mistaken. I know to whom I am speaking.
This child, now in his nurse's arms, will be
greater than his brother. This is the one who
is to convey his father's name and titles to succeeding
generations." This prediction was fulfilled;
for the robust and healthy Henry died,
and the feeble and sickly-looking Charles lived
and grew, and succeeded, in due time, to his
father's throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An explanation.</div>

<p>Now inasmuch as, at the time when this
prediction was uttered, there seemed to be little
human probability of its fulfillment, it attracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
attention; its unexpected and startling character
made every one notice and remember it;
and the old laird was at once an object of interest
and wonder. It is probable that this desire
to excite the admiration of the auditors, mingled
insensibly with a sort of poetic enthusiasm,
which a rude age and mountainous scenery always
inspires, was the origin of a great many
such predictions as these; and then, in the end,
those only which turned out to be true were
remembered, while the rest were forgotten; and
this was the way that the reality of such prophetic
powers came to be generally believed in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles's titles of nobility.</div>

<p>Feeble and uncertain of life as the infant
Charles appeared to be, they conferred upon
him, as is customary in the case of young princes,
various titles of nobility. He was made a
duke, a marquis, an earl, and a baron, before
he had strength enough to lift up his head in
his nurse's arms. His title as duke was Duke
of Albany; and as this was the highest of his
nominal honors, he was generally known under
that designation while he remained in Scotland.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles's governess.</div>

<p>When his father left him, in order to go to
England and take possession of his new throne,
he appointed a governess to take charge of the
health and education of the young duke. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
governess was Lady Cary. The reason why
she was appointed was, not because of her possessing
any peculiar qualifications for such a
charge, but because her husband, Sir Robert
Cary, had been the messenger employed by the
British government to communicate to James
the death of Elizabeth, and to announce to him
his accession to the throne. The bearer of
good news to a monarch must always be rewarded,
and James recompensed Sir Robert for
his service by appointing his wife to the post of
governess of his infant son. The office undoubtedly
had its honors and emoluments, with
very little of responsibility or care.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Windsor Castle.</div>

<p>One of the chief residences of the English
monarchs is Windsor Castle. It is situated
above London, on the Thames, on the southern
shore. It is on an eminence overlooking the
river and the delightful valley through which
the river here meanders. In the rear is a very
extensive park or forest, which is penetrated in
every direction by rides and walks almost innumerable.
It has been for a long time the chief
country residence of the British kings. It is
very spacious, containing within its walls many
courts and quadrangles, with various buildings
surrounding them, some ancient and some modern.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1610.</div>

<p>Here King James held his court after his
arrival in England, and in about a year he sent
for the little Charles to join him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journey to London.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A mother's love.</div>

<p>The child traveled very slowly, and by very
easy stages, his nurses and attendants watching
over him with great solicitude all the way.
The journey was made in the month of October.
His mother watched his arrival with great interest.
Being so feeble and helpless, he was, of
course, her favorite child. By an instinct which
very strongly evinces the wisdom and goodness
which implanted it, a mother always bestows
a double portion of her love upon the frail, the
helpless, and the suffering. Instead of being
wearied out with protracted and incessant calls
for watchfulness and care, she feels only a deeper
sympathy and love, in proportion to the infirmities
which call for them, and thus finds
her highest happiness in what we might expect
would be a weariness and a toil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rejoicings.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles's continued feebleness.</div>

<p>Little Charles was four years old when he
reached Windsor Castle. They celebrated his
arrival with great rejoicings, and a day or two
afterward they invested him with the title of
Duke of York, a still higher distinction than he
had before attained. Soon after this, when he
was perhaps five or six years of age, a gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was appointed to take the charge of his
education. His health gradually improved,
though he still continued helpless and feeble.
It was a long time before he could walk, on account
of some malformation of his limbs. He
learned to talk, too, very late and very slowly.
Besides the general feebleness of his constitution,
which kept him back in all these things,
there was an impediment in his speech, which
affected him very much in childhood, and which,
in fact, never entirely disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His progress in learning.</div>

<p>As soon, however, as he commenced his studies
under his new tutor, he made much greater
progress than had been expected. It was
soon observed that the feebleness which had
attached to him pertained more to the body
than to the mind. He advanced with considerable
rapidity in his learning. His progress
was, in fact, in some degree, promoted by his
bodily infirmities, which kept him from playing
with the other boys of the court, and led him
to like to be still, and to retire from scenes of
sport and pleasure which he could not share.</p>

<p>The same cause operated to make him not
agreeable as a companion, and he was not a
favorite among those around him. They called
him <em>Baby</em>Charley. His temper seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>be in some sense soured by the feeling of his inferiority,
and by the jealousy he would naturally
experience in finding himself, the son of a
king, so outstripped in athletic sports by those
whom he regarded as his inferiors in rank and
station.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1616.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles improves in health.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Death of his brother.</div>

<p>The lapse of a few years, however, after this
time, made a total change in Charles's position
and prospects. His health improved, and his
constitution began to be confirmed and established.
When he was about twelve years of
age, too, his brother Henry died. This circumstance
made an entire change in all his prospects
of life. The eyes of the whole kingdom,
and, in fact, of all Europe, were now upon him
as the future sovereign of England. His sister
Elizabeth, who was a few years older than himself,
was, about this time, married to a German
prince, with great pomp and ceremony,
young Charles acting the part of brideman.
In consequence of his new position as heir-apparent
to the throne, he was advanced to new
honors, and had new titles conferred upon him,
until at last, when he was sixteen years of age,
he was made Prince of Wales, and certain revenues
were appropriated to support a court for
him, that he might be surrounded with external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>circumstances and insignia of rank and power,
corresponding with his prospective greatness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1618.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles's love of athletic sports.</div>

<p>In the mean time his health and strength
rapidly improved, and with the improvement
came a taste for manly and athletic sports, and
the attainment of excellence in them. He became
very famous for his skill in all the exploits
and performances of the young men of those
days, such as shooting, riding, vaulting, and
tilting at tournaments. From being a weak,
sickly, and almost helpless child, he became, at
twenty, an active, athletic young man, full of
life and spirit, and ready for any romantic enterprise.
In fact, when he was twenty-three
years old, he embarked in a romantic enterprise
which attracted the attention of all the
world. This enterprise will presently be described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's style of living.</div>

<p>There was at this time, in the court of King
James, a man who became very famous afterward
as a favorite and follower of Charles. He
is known in history under the name of the
Duke of Buckingham. His name was originally
George Villiers. He was a very handsome
young man, and he seems to have attracted
King James's attention at first on this account.
James found him a convenient attendant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>and made him, at last, his principal favorite.
He raised him to a high rank, and conferred
upon him, among other titles, that of
Duke of Buckingham. The other persons
about the court were very envious and jealous
of his influence and power; but they were
obliged to submit to it. He lived in great
state and splendor, and for many years was
looked up to by the whole kingdom as one of
the greatest personages in the realm. We
shall learn hereafter how he came to his end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Royalty.</div>

<div class="sidenote">True character of royalty.</div>

<p>If the reader imagines, from the accounts
which have been given thus far in this chapter
of the pomp and parade of royalty, of the castles
and the ceremonies, the titles of nobility,
and the various insignia of rank and power,
which we have alluded to so often, that the
mode of life which royalty led in those days
was lofty, dignified, and truly great, he will be
very greatly deceived. All these things were
merely for show&mdash;things put on for public display,
to gratify pride and impress the people,
who never looked behind the scenes, with high
ideas of the grandeur of those who, as they
were taught, ruled over them by a divine right.
It would be hard to find, in any class of society
except those reputed infamous, more low, gross,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and vulgar modes of life than have been exhibited
generally in the royal palaces of Europe
for the last five hundred years. King James
the First has, among English sovereigns, rather
a high character for sobriety and gravity of
deportment, and purity of morals; but the
glimpses we get of the real, every-day routine
of his domestic life, are such as to show that
the pomp and parade of royalty is mere glittering
tinsel, after all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1620.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king and Buckingham.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Indecent correspondence.</div>

<p>The historians of the day tell such stories as
these. The king was at one time very dejected
and melancholy, when Buckingham contrived
this plan to amuse him. In the first
place, however, we ought to say, in order to illustrate
the terms on which he and Buckingham
lived together, that the king always called
Buckingham <em>Steeny</em>, which was a contraction
of Stephen. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen was always represented,
in the Catholic pictures of the saints, as
a very handsome man, and Buckingham being
handsome too, James called him Steeny by way
of compliment. Steeny called the king <em>his dad</em>,
and used to sign himself, in his letters, "your
slave and dog Steeny." There are extant some
letters which passed between the king and his
favorite, written, on the part of the king, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
style of grossness and indecency such that the
chroniclers of those days said that they were
not fit to be printed. They would not "blot
their pages" with them, they said. King
Charles's letters were more properly expressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's pig.</div>

<p>To return, then, to our story. The king was
very much dejected and melancholy. Steeny,
in order to divert him, had a pig dressed up in
the clothes of an infant child. Buckingham's
mother, who was a countess, personated the
nurse, dressed also carefully for the occasion.
Another person put on a bishop's robes, satin
gown, lawn sleeves, and the other pontifical
ornaments. They also provided a baptismal
font, a prayer-book, and other things necessary
for a religious ceremony, and then invited the
king to come in to attend a baptism. The
king came, and the pretended bishop began to
read the service, the assistants looking gravely
on, until the squealing of the pig brought all
gravity to an end. The king was <em>not</em> pleased;
but the historian thinks the reason was, not
any objection which he had to such a profanation,
but to his not happening to be in a mood
for it at that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James's petulance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The story of Gib.</div>

<p>There was a negotiation going on for a long
time for a marriage between one of the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>sons, first Henry, and afterward Charles, and a
princess of Spain. At one time the king lost
some of the papers, and was storming about the
palace in a great rage because he could not
find them. At last he chanced to meet a certain
Scotchman, a servant of his, named Gib,
and, like a vexed and impatient child, who lays
the charge of a lost plaything upon any body
who happens to be at hand to receive it, he put
the responsibility of the loss of the papers upon
Gib. "I remember," said he, "I gave them
to you to take care of. What have you done
with them?" The faithful servant fell upon
his knees, and protested that he had not received
them. The king was only made the
more angry by this contradiction, and kicked
the Scotchman as he kneeled upon the floor.
The man rose and left the apartment, saying,
"I have always been faithful to your majesty,
and have not deserved such treatment as this.
I can not remain in your service under such a
degradation. I shall never see you again."
He left the palace, and went away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's frankness.</div>

<p>A short time after this, the person to whose
custody the king had really committed the papers
came in, and, on learning that they were
wanted, produced them. The king was ashamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>of his conduct. He sent for his Scotch servant
again, and was not easy until he was found
and brought into his presence. He then kneeled
before him and asked his forgiveness, and
said he should not rise till he had forgiven him.
Gib was disposed to evade the request, and
urged the king to rise; but James would not
do so until he had said he forgave him, in so
many words. The whole case shows how little
of dignity and noble bearing there really was
in the manners and conduct of the king in his
daily life, though we are almost ready to overlook
the ridiculous childishness and folly of his
fault, on account of the truly noble frankness
and honesty with which he acknowledged it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Glitter of royalty.</div>

<p>Thus, though every thing in which royalty
appeared before the public was conducted with
great pomp and parade, this external magnificence
was then, and always has been, an outside
show, without any thing corresponding to
it within. The great mass of the people of
England saw only the outside. They gazed
with admiration at the spectacle of magnificence
and splendor which royalty always presented
to their eyes, whenever they beheld it
from the distant and humble points of view
which their position afforded them. Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Charles, on the other hand, was behind the curtain.
His childhood and youth were exposed
fully to all the real influences of these scenes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1622.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The appearance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The reality.</div>

<p>The people of England submitted to be governed
by such men, not because they thought them
qualified to govern, or that the circumstances
under which their characters were formed were
such as were calculated to form, in a proper manner,
the minds of the rulers of a Christian people.
They did not know what those circumstances
were. In their conceptions they had grand ideas
of royal character and life, and imagined the
splendid palaces which some saw, but more only
heard of, at Westminster, were filled with true
greatness and glory. They were really filled
with vulgarity, vice, and shame. James was to
them King James the First, monarch of Great
Britain, France, and Ireland, and Charles was
Charles, Prince of Wales, Duke of York, and
heir-apparent to the throne. Whereas, within
the palace, to all who saw them and knew them
there, and really, so far as their true moral position
was concerned, the father was "Old
Dad," and the son, what his father always
called him till he was twenty-four years old,
"Baby Charley."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Expedition into Spain.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1623.</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">I</span>N order that the reader may understand
fully the nature of the romantic enterprise
in which, as we have already said, Prince
Charles embarked when he was a little over
twenty years of age, we must premise that
Frederic, the German prince who married
Charles's sister Elizabeth some years before,
was the ruler of a country in Germany called
the Palatinate. It was on the banks of the
Rhine. Frederic's title, as ruler of this country,
was Elector Palatine. There are a great
many independent states in Germany, whose
sovereigns have various titles, and are possessed
of various prerogatives and powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palatinate.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Wars between the Protestants and Catholics.</div>

<p>Now it happened that, at this time, very
fierce civil wars were raging between the Catholics
and the Protestants in Germany. Frederic
got drawn into these wars on the Protestant
side. His motive was not any desire to
promote the progress of what he considered the
true faith, but only a wish to extend his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dominions, and add to his own power; for he
had been promised a kingdom, in addition to
his Palatinate, if he would assist the people of
the kingdom to gain the victory over their
Catholic foes. He embarked in this enterprise
without consulting with James, his father-in-law,
knowing that he would probably disapprove
of such dangerous ambition. James was, in
fact, very sorry afterward to hear of Frederic's
having engaged in such a contest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frederic dispossessed of his dominions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Flees to Holland.</div>

<p>The result was quite as disastrous as James
feared. Frederic not only failed of getting his
new kingdom, but he provoked the rage of the
Catholic powers against whom he had undertaken
to contend, and they poured a great army
into his own original territory, and made an
easy conquest of it. Frederic fled to Holland,
and remained there a fugitive and an exile, hoping
to obtain help in some way from James, in
his efforts to recover his lost dominions.</p>

<p>The people of England felt a great interest
in Frederic's unhappy fate, and were very desirous
that James should raise an army and
give him some efficient assistance. One reason
for this was that they were Protestants, and
they were always ready to embark, on the
Protestant side, in the Continental quarrels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Elizabeth.</div>

<p>Another reason was their interest in Elizabeth,
the wife of Frederic, who had so recently left
England a blooming bride, and whom they
still considered as in some sense pertaining to
the royal family of England, and as having a
right to look to all her father's subjects for protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James's plan.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Donna Maria.</div>

<p>But King James himself had no inclination
to go to war in such a quarrel. He was inactive
in mind, and childish, and he had little
taste for warlike enterprises. He undertook,
however, to accomplish the object in another
way. The King of Spain, being one of the
most powerful of the Catholic sovereigns, had
great influence in all their councils. He had
also a beautiful daughter, Donna Maria, called,
as Spanish princesses are styled, the Infanta.
Now James conceived the design of proposing
that his son Charles should marry Donna
Maria, and that, in the treaty of marriage,
there should be a stipulation providing that the
Palatinate should be restored to Frederic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations with Spain.</div>

<p>These negotiations were commenced, and
they went on two or three years without making
any sensible progress. Donna Maria was
a Catholic, and Charles a Protestant. Now a
Catholic could not marry a Protestant without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a special dispensation from the pope. To get
this dispensation required new negotiations and
delays. In the midst of it all, the King of Spain,
Donna Maria's father, died, and his son, her
brother, named Philip, succeeded him. Then
the negotiations had all to be commenced anew.
It was supposed that the King of Spain did not
wish to have the affair concluded, but liked to
have it in discussion, as it tended to keep the
King of England more or less under his control.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obstacles and delays.</div>

<p>So they kept sending embassadors back
and forth, with drafts of treaties, articles, conditions,
and stipulations without number. There
were endless discussions about securing to Donna
Maria the full enjoyment of the Catholic religion
in England, and express agreements
were proposed and debated in respect to her
having a chapel, and priests, and the right to
celebrate mass, and to enjoy, in fact, all the
other privileges which she had been accustomed
to exercise in her own native land. James did
not object. He agreed to every thing; but still,
some how or other, the arrangement could not
be closed. There was always some pretext for
delay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's proposal.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of the adventure.</div>

<p>At last Buckingham proposed to Charles
that they two should set off for Spain in person,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>and see if they could not settle the affair.
Buckingham's motive was partly a sort of reckless
daring, which made him love any sort of
adventure, and partly a desire to circumvent
and thwart a rival of his, the Earl of Bristol,
who had charge of the negotiations. It may
seem to the reader that a simple journey from
London to Madrid, of a young man, for the
purpose of visiting a lady whom he was wishing
to espouse, was no such extraordinary undertaking
as to attract the attention of a spirited
young man to it from love of adventure.
The truth is, however, that, with the ideas that
then prevailed in respect to royal etiquette,
there was something very unusual in this plan.
The prince and Buckingham knew very well
that the consent of the statesmen and high officers
of the realm could never be obtained, and
that their only alternative was, accordingly, to
go off secretly and in disguise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's dissimulation.</div>

<p>It seemed, however, to be rather necessary
to get the king's consent. But Buckingham
did not anticipate much difficulty in this, as he
was accustomed to manage James almost like
a child. He had not, however, been on very
good terms with Charles, having been accustomed
to treat him in the haughty and imperious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
manner which James would usually yield
to, but which Charles was more inclined to resist
and resent. When Buckingham, at length,
conceived of this scheme of going into Spain,
he changed his deportment toward Charles,
and endeavored, by artful dissimulation, to
gain his kind regard. He soon succeeded, and
then he proposed his plan.</p>

<p>He represented to Charles that the sole cause
of the delays in settling the question of his marriage
was because it was left so entirely in the
hands of embassadors, negotiators, and statesmen,
who involved every thing in endless mazes.
"Take the affair into your own hands,"
said he, "like a man. Set off with me, and go
at once into Spain. Astonish them with your
sudden and unexpected presence. The Infanta
will be delighted at such a proof of your ardor,
courage, and devotion, and will do all in
her power to co-operate with you in bringing
the affair at once to a close. Besides, the
whole world will admire the originality and
boldness of the achievement."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles persuaded.</div>

<p>Charles was easily persuaded. The next
thing was to get the king's consent. Charles
and Buckingham went to his palace one day,
and, watching their opportunity when he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pretty merry with wine, Charles told him he
had a favor to ask, and wanted his father to
promise to grant it before he knew what it was.
James, after some hesitation, half in jest and
half in earnest, agreed to it. They made him
promise that he would not tell any one what it
was, and then explained their plan. The king
was thunderstruck; his amazement sobered him
at once. He retracted his promise. He never
could consent to any such scheme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James's perplexity.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He reluctantly yields.</div>

<p>Buckingham here interposed with his aid.
He told the king it was perfectly safe for the
prince to go, and that this measure was the
only plan which could bring the marriage
treaty to a close. Besides, he said, if he and
the prince were there, they could act far more
effectually than any embassadors in securing
the restoration of the Palatinate to Frederic.
James could not withstand these entreaties and
arguments, and he finally gave a reluctant consent
to the plan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James's fears.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Royal captives.</div>

<p>He repented, however, as soon as the consent
was given, and when Charles and Buckingham
came next to see him, he said it must
be given up. One great source of his anxiety
was a fear that his son might be taken and kept
a prisoner, either in France or Spain, and detained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>a long time in captivity. Such a captive
was always, in those days, a very tempting
prize to a rival power. Personages of very
high rank may be detained as captives, while
all the time those who detain them may pretend
not to confine them at all, the guards and
sentinels being only marks of regal state, and
indications of the desire of the power into whose
hands they have fallen to treat them in a manner
comporting with their rank. Then there
were always, in those days, questions and disputes
pending between the rival courts of England,
France, and Spain, out of which it was
easy to get a pretext for detaining any strolling
prince who might cross the frontier, as security
for the fulfillment of some stipulation, or for doing
some act of justice claimed. James, knowing
well how much faith and honor were to be
expected of kings and courts, was afraid to
trust his son in French or Spanish dominions.
He said he certainly could not consent to his
going, without first sending to <em>France</em>, at least,
for a safe-conduct&mdash;that is, a paper from the
government, pledging the honor of the king
not to molest or interrupt him in his journey
through his dominions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's violence.</div>

<p>Buckingham, instead of attempting to reassure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>the king by fresh arguments and persuasions,
broke out into a passion, accused him of
violating his promise not to reveal their plan to
any one, as he knew, he said, that this new opposition
had been put into his head by some of
his counselors to whom he had made known
the design. The king denied this, and was
terrified, agitated, and distressed by Buckingham's
violence. He wept like a child. His
opposition at length gave way a second time,
and he said they might go. They named two
attendants whom they wanted to go with them.
One was an officer of the king's household,
named Collington, who was then in the anteroom.
They asked the king to call him in to
see if he would go. When Collington came in,
the king accosted him with, "Here's Steeny
and Baby Charley that want to go to Spain
and fetch the Infanta. What think you of
it?" Collington did not think well of it at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Angry disputes.</div>

<p>There followed a new relapse on the part of
the king from his consent, a new storm of anger
from Buckingham, more sullen obstinacy
on the part of Charles, with profane criminations
and recriminations one against another.
The whole scene was what, if it had occurred
any where else than in a palace, would have
been called a brawl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">James's distress.</div>

<p>It ended, as brawls usually do, in the triumph
of the most unreasonable and violent.
James threw himself upon a bed which was in
the room, weeping bitterly, and saying that
they would go, and he should lose his Baby
Charley. Considering that Charles was now
the monarch's only child remaining at home,
and that, as heir to the crown, his life was of
great consequence to the realm, it is not surprising
that his father was distressed at the
idea of his exposing himself to danger on such
an expedition; but one not accustomed to what
is behind the scenes in royal life would expect
a little more dignity and propriety in the mode
of expressing paternal solicitude from a king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles and Buckingham depart.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles and Buckingham's boisterous conduct.</div>

<p>Charles and Buckingham set off secretly
from London; their two attendants were to
join them in different places&mdash;the last at Dover,
where they were to embark. They laid
aside all marks of distinction in dress, such as
persons of high rank used to wear in those
days, and took the garb of the common people.
They put on wigs, also, the hair being very
long, so as to shade the face and alter the expression
of their countenances. These external
disguises, however, were all that they could
command. They could not assume the modest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and quiet air and manner of persons in the ordinary
walks of life, but made such displays,
and were so liberal in the use of their money,
and carried such an air and manner in all that
they did and said, that all who had any intercourse
with them perceived that they were in
disguise. They were supposed to be wild
blades, out on some frolic or other, but still
they were allowed to pass along without any
molestation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrested at Dover.</div>

<p>They were, however, stopped at Dover,
where in some way they attracted the attention
of the mayor of the town. Dover is on
the Channel, opposite to Calais, at the narrowest
point. It was, of course, especially in those
days, the point where the principal intercourse
between the two nations centered. The magistrates
of the two towns were obliged, consequently,
to be on the alert, to prevent the escape
of fugitives and criminals, as well as to
guard against the efforts of smugglers, or the
entrance of spies or other secret enemies. The
Mayor of Dover arrested our heroes. They
told him that their names were Tom Smith
and Jack Smith; these, in fact, were the names
with which they had traveled through England
thus far. They said that they were traveling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>for amusement. The mayor did not believe
them. He thought they were going across to
the French coast to fight a duel. This was
often done in those days. They then told him
that they were indeed persons of rank in disguise,
and that they were going to inspect the
English fleet. He finally allowed them to embark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival at Paris.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Princess Henrietta.</div>

<p>On landing at Calais, they traveled post to
Paris, strictly preserving their incognito, but
assuming such an air and bearing as to create
the impression that they were not what they
pretended. When they reached Paris, Buckingham
could not resist the temptation of showing
Charles a little of life, and he contrived to
get admitted to a party at court, where Charles
saw, among other ladies who attracted his attention,
the Princess Henrietta. He was much
struck with her beauty and grace, but he little
thought that it was this princess, and not the
Infanta whom he was going in pursuit of, who
was really to become his wife, and the future
Queen of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bourdeaux.</div>

<p>The young travelers thought it not prudent
to remain long in Paris, and they accordingly
left that city, and pressed forward as rapidly as
possible toward the Spanish frontier. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
managed, however, to conduct always in such
a way as to attract attention. Although they
were probably sincerely desirous of not having
their true rank and character known, still they
could not resist the temptation to assume such
an air and bearing as to make people wonder
who they were, and thus increase the spirit and
adventure of their journey. At Bourdeaux
they received invitations from some grandees
to be present at some great gala, but they declined,
saying that they were only poor gentlemen
traveling to inform their minds, and were
not fit to appear in such gay assemblies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entrance into Madrid.</div>

<p>At last they approached Madrid. They had,
besides Collington, another attendant who spoke
the Spanish language, and served them as an
interpreter. They separated from these two
the day before they entered Madrid, so as to
attract the less attention. Their attendants
were to be left behind for a day, and afterward
were to follow them into the city. The name
of the British embassador at Madrid was the
Earl of Bristol. He had had charge of all the
negotiations in respect to the marriage, and to
the restoration of the Palatinate, and believed
that he had brought them almost to a successful
termination. He lived in a palace in Madrid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and, as is customary with the embassadors
of great powers at the courts of great powers,
in a style of the highest pomp and splendor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bristol's amazement.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles's reception.</div>

<p>Buckingham took the prince directly to Bristol's
house. Bristol was utterly confounded at
seeing them. Nothing could be worse, he said,
in respect to the completion of the treaty, than
the prince's presence in Madrid. The introduction
of so new and extraordinary an element
into the affair would undo all that had
been done, and lead the King of Spain to begin
anew, and go over all the ground again. In
speaking of this occurrence to another, he said
that just as he was on the point of coming to
a satisfactory conclusion of his long negotiations
and toils, a demon in the shape of Prince
Charles came suddenly upon the stage to thwart
and defeat them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grand procession.</div>

<p>The Spanish court was famous in those days&mdash;in
fact, it has always been famous&mdash;for its punctilious
attention to etiquette and parade; and
as soon as the prince's arrival was known to
the king, he immediately began to make preparations
to welcome him with all possible
pomp and ceremony. A great procession was
made through the Prado, which is a street in
Madrid famous for promenades, processions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and public displays of all kinds. In moving
through the city on this occasion, the king and
Prince Charles walked together, the monarch
thus treating the prince as his equal. There
was a great canopy of state borne over their
heads as they moved along. This canopy was
supported by a large number of persons of the
highest rank. The streets, and the windows
and balconies of the houses on each side, were
thronged with spectators, dressed in the gay and
splendid court dresses of those times. When
they reached the end of the route, and were
about to enter the gate of the palace, there was
a delay to decide which should enter first, the
king and the prince each insisting on giving
the precedence to the other. At last it was
settled by their both going in together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish etiquette.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Infanta kept secluded.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Athletic amusements.</div>

<p>If the prince thus, on the one hand, derived
some benefit in the gratification of his pride by
the Spanish etiquette and parade, he suffered
some inconvenience and disappointment from it,
on the other hand, by its excluding him from
all intercourse or acquaintance with the Infanta.
It was not proper for the young man to
see or to speak to the young lady, in such a
case as this, until the arrangements had been
more fully matured. The formalities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
engagement must have proceeded beyond the
point which they had yet reached, before the
bridegroom could be admitted to a personal interview
with the bride. It is true, he could
see her in public, where she was in a crowd,
with other ladies of the court, and where he
could have no communication with her; but
this was all. They arranged it, however, to
give Charles as many opportunities of this kind
as possible. They got up shows, in which the
prince could see the Infanta among the spectators;
and they arranged tiltings and ridings at
the ring, and other athletic sports, such as
Charles excelled in, and let him perform his exploits
in her presence. His rivals in these contests
did not have the incivility to conquer him,
and his performances excited expressions, at
least, of universal admiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles steals an interview.</div>

<p>But the prince and Buckingham did not
very willingly submit to the stiffness and formality
of the Spanish court. As soon as they
came to feel a little at home, they began to act
with great freedom. At one time the prince
learned that the Infanta was going, early in the
morning, to take a walk in some private pleasure
grounds, at a country house in the neighborhood
of Madrid, and he conceived the design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of gaining an interview with her there by
stealth. He accordingly repaired to the place,
got admitted in some way within the precincts
of the palace, and contrived to clamber over a
high wall which separated him from the grounds
in which the Infanta was walking, and so let
himself down into her presence. The accounts
do not state whether she herself was pleased or
alarmed, but the officer who had her in charge,
an old nobleman, was very much alarmed, and
begged the prince to retire, as he himself would
be subject to a very severe punishment if it
were known that he had allowed such an interview.
Finally they opened the door, and the
prince went out. Many people were pleased
with this and similar adventures of the prince
and of Buckingham, but the leading persons
about the court were displeased with them.
Their precise and formal notions of propriety
were very much shocked by such freedoms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irregularities.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Delays and difficulties.</div>

<p>Besides, it was soon found that the characters
of these high-born visitors, especially that
of Buckingham, were corrupt, and their lives
very irregular. Buckingham was accustomed
to treat King James in a very bold, familiar,
and imperious manner, and he fell insensibly
into the same habits of intercourse with those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
about him in Spain. The little reserve and
caution which he manifested at first soon wore
off, and he began to be very generally disliked.
In the mean time the negotiation was, as Bristol
had expected, very much put back by the
prince's arrival. The King of Spain formed new
plans, and thought of new conditions to impose.
The Catholics, too, thought that Charles's coming
thus into a Catholic country, indicated some
leaning, on his part, toward the Catholic faith.
The pope actually wrote him a long letter, the
object of which was to draw him off from the
ranks of Protestantism. Charles wrote a civil,
but rather an evasive reply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The magic picture.</div>

<p>In the mean time, King James wrote childish
letters from time to time to his two dear boys, as
he called them, and he sent them a great many
presents of jewelry and splendid dresses, some
for them to wear themselves, and some for the
prince to offer as gifts to the Infanta. Among
these, he describes, in one of his letters, a little
mirror, set in a case which was to be worn hung
at the girdle. He wrote to Charles that when
he gave this mirror to the Infanta, he must tell
her that it was a picture which he had had imbued
with magical virtue by means of incantations
and charms, so that whenever she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
looked into it, she would see a portrait of the
most beautiful princess in England, France, or
Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The pope's dispensation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The treaty signed.</div>

<p>At last the great obstacle in the way of the
conclusion of the treaty of marriage, which consisted
in the delays and difficulties in getting
the pope's dispensation, was removed. The
dispensation came. But then the King of
Spain wanted some new guarantees in respect
to the privileges of Catholics in England, under
pretense of securing more perfectly the rights
of the Infanta and of her attendants when they
should have arrived in that country. The
truth was, he probably wanted to avail himself
of the occasion to gain some foothold for
the Catholic faith in England, which country
had become almost entirely Protestant. At
length, however, all obstacles seemed to be removed,
and the treaty was signed. The news
of it was received with great joy in England,
as it seemed to secure a permanent alliance
between the two powerful countries of England
and Spain. Great celebrations took place in
London, to do honor to the occasion. A chapel
was built for the Infanta, to be ready for her
on her arrival; and a fleet was fitted out to convey
her and her attendants to her new home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham is hated.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He breaks off the match.</div>

<p>In the mean time, however, although the
king had signed the treaty, there was a strong
party formed against the marriage in Spain.
Buckingham was hated and despised. Charles,
they saw, was almost entirely under his influence.
They said they would rather see the Infanta
in her grave than in the hands of such
men. Buckingham became irritated by the
hostility he had awakened, and he determined
to break off the match entirely. He wrote
home to James that he had no idea that the
Spanish court had any intention of carrying
the arrangement really into effect; that they
were procrastinating the affair on every possible
pretext, and that he was really afraid that,
if the prince were to attempt to leave the country,
they would interpose and detain him as a
prisoner. King James was very much alarmed.
He wrote in the greatest trepidation, urging
"the lads" to come away immediately, leaving
a proxy behind them, if necessary, for the solemnization
of the marriage. This was what
Buckingham wanted, and he and the prince
began to make preparations for their departure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Festivities at the Escurial.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Taking leave.</div>

<p>The King of Spain, far from interposing any
obstacles in the way, only treated them with
greater and higher marks of respect as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
time of their separation from his court drew
nigh. He arranged great and pompous ceremonies
to honor their departure. He accompanied
them, with all the grandees of the court,
as far as to the Escurial, which is a famous
royal palace not far from Madrid, built and
furnished in the most sumptuous style of magnificence
and splendor. Here they had parting
feasts and celebrations. Here the prince
took his leave of the Infanta, Bristol serving as
interpreter, to translate his parting speeches
into Spanish, so that she could understand them.
From the Escurial the prince and Buckingham,
with a great many English noblemen
who had followed them to Madrid, and a great
train of attendants, traveled toward the seacoast,
where a fleet of vessels were ready to
receive them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return to London.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Spanish match broken off.</div>

<p>They embarked at a port called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew.
They came very near being lost in a storm of
mist and rain which came upon them while
going out to the ships, which were at a distance
from the shore, in small boats provided
to convey them. Having escaped this danger,
they arrived safely at Portsmouth, the great
landing point of the British navy on the southern
shores of England, and thence proceeded to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>London. They sent back orders that the proxy
should not be used, and the match was finally
abandoned, each party accusing the other of
duplicity and bad faith. King James was,
however, very glad to get his son safe back
again, and the people made as many bonfires
and illuminations to celebrate the breaking up
of this Catholic match, as they had done before
to do honor to its supposed completion. As all
hope of recovering the Palatinate by negotiation
was now past, the king began to prepare
for the attempt to reconquer it by force of arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1625.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">K</span>ING JAMES made slow progress in his
military preparations. He could not
raise the funds without the action of Parliament,
and the houses were not in very good
humor. The expenses of the prince's visit to
Spain had been enormous, and other charges,
arising out of the pomp and splendor with which
the arrangements of the court were maintained,
gave them a little feeling of discontent. They
had other grievances of which they were disposed
to complain, and they began to look upon
this war, notwithstanding its Protestant character,
as one in which the king was only striving
to recover his son-in-law's dominions, and,
consequently, as one which pertained more to
his personal interests than to the public welfare
of the realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James prepares for war.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He falls ill.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Suspicions.</div>

<p>While things were in this state the king fell
sick. The mother of the Duke of Buckingham
undertook to prescribe for him. It was understood
that Buckingham himself, who had, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the course of the Spanish enterprise, and since
his return, acquired an entire ascendency over
Charles, was not unwilling that his old master
should leave the stage, and the younger one
reign in his stead; and that his mother shared
in this feeling. At any rate, her prescriptions
made the king much worse. He had the sacrament
administered to him in his sick chamber,
and said that he derived great comfort from
it. One morning, very early, he sent for the
prince to come and see him. Charles rose,
dressed himself, and came. His father had
something to say to him, and tried to speak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of James.</div>

<p>He could not. His strength was too far gone.
He fell back upon his pillow, and died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accession of Charles.</div>

<p>Charles was, of course, now king. The
theory in the English monarchy is, that the
king never dies. So soon as the person in
whom the royal sovereignty resides ceases to
breathe, the principle of supremacy vests immediately
in his successor, by a law of transmission
entirely independent of the will of man.
The son becomes king by a divine right. His
being proclaimed and crowned, as he usually
is, at some convenient time early in his reign,
are not ceremonies which <em>make</em> him king.
They only acknowledge him to be so. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
does not, in any sense, derive his powers and
prerogatives from these acts. He only receives
from his people, by means of them, a recognition
of his right to the high office to which he
has already been inducted by the fiat of Heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different ideas of the nature and end of government.</div>

<p>It will be observed, thus, that the ideas which
prevailed in respect to the nature and province
of government, were very different in England
at that time from those which are entertained
in America at the present day. With us, the
administration of government is merely <em>a business</em>,
transacted for the benefit of the people
by their agents&mdash;men who are put in power
for this purpose, and who, like other agents,
are responsible to their principals for the manner
in which they fulfill their trusts. But government
in England was, in the days of the
Stuarts&mdash;and it is so to a great extent at the
present day&mdash;a <em>right</em> which one family possessed,
and which entitled that family to certain immunities,
powers, and prerogatives, which they
held entirely independent of any desire, on the
part of the people, that they should exercise
them, or even their <em>consent</em> that they should do
so. The right to govern the realm of Great
Britain was a sort of estate which descended
to Charles from his ancestors, and with the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and enjoyment of which the community
had no right to interfere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hereditary succession illustrated by an argument.</div>

<p>This seems, at first view, very absurd to us,
but it is not particularly absurd. Charles's
lawyers would say to any plain proprietor of a
piece of land, who might call in question his
right to govern the country, the king holds his
crown by precisely the same tenure that you
hold your farm. Why should you be the exclusive
possessor of that land, while so many
poor beggars are starving? Because it has descended
to you from your ancestors, and nothing
has descended to them. And it is precisely
so that the right to manage the fleets and
armies, and to administer the laws of the realm,
has descended, under the name of <em>sovereignty</em>,
to him, and no such political power has descended
to you.</p>

<p>True, the farmer would reply; but in matters
of government we are to consider what
will promote the general good. The great object
to be attained is the welfare and happiness
of the community. Now, if this general welfare
comes into competition with the supposed
rights of individuals, arising from such a principle
as hereditary succession, the latter ought
certainly to yield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Property and prerogatives.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hereditary succession an absolute right.</div>

<p>But why, might the lawyer reply, should
rights founded on hereditary succession yield
any more readily in the case of <em>government</em>
than in the case of <em>property</em>? The distribution
of property influences the general welfare quite
as much as the management of power. Suppose
it were proved that the general welfare of
your parish would be promoted by the division
of your land among the destitute there. You
have nothing to oppose to such a proposition
but your hereditary right. And the king has
that to oppose to any plan of a division of his
prerogatives and powers among the people who
would like to share them.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of this reasoning
on this side of the Atlantic, and at the present
day, it was considered very satisfactory in England
two or three centuries ago. The true
and proper jurisdiction of an English monarch,
as it had existed from ancient times, was considered
as an <em>absolute right</em>, vesting in each
successive inheritor of the crown, and which
the community could not justly interfere with
or disturb for any reasons less imperious than
such as would authorize an interference with
the right of succession to private property. Indeed,
it is probable that, with most men at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
that time, an inherited right to <em>govern</em> was
regarded as the most sacred of the two.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three things hereditary in England.</div>

<p>The fact seems to be, that the right of a son
to come into the place of his father, whether in
respect to property, power, or social rank, is
not a natural, inherent, and indefeasible right,
but a <em>privilege</em> which society accords, as a
matter of convenience and expediency. In England,
expediency is, on the whole, considered
to require that all three of these things, viz.,
property, rank, and power, in certain cases,
should descend from father to son. In this
country, on the other hand, we confine the hereditament
to property, abrogating it in the
case of rank and power. In neither case is
there probably any absolute natural right, but
a conventional right is allowed to take its place
in one, or another, or all of these particulars,
according to the opinion of the community in
respect to what its true interests and the general
welfare, on the whole, require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stuarts.</div>

<p>The kings themselves of this Stuart race&mdash;which
race includes Mary Queen of Scots, the
mother of the line, and James <abbr title="1st">I</abbr>., Charles <abbr title="1st">I</abbr>.,
Charles <abbr title="2nd">II</abbr>., and James <abbr title="2nd">II</abbr>.&mdash;entertained very
high ideas of these hereditary rights of theirs
to govern the realm of England. They felt a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
determination to maintain these rights and
powers at all hazards. Charles ascended the
throne with these feelings, and the chief point
of interest in the history of his reign is the contest
in which he engaged with the English people
in his attempts to maintain them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Legislature in the United States.</div>

<p>The body with which the king came most
immediately into conflict in this long struggle
were the two houses of Parliament. And here
American readers are very liable to fall into a
mistake by considering the houses of Parliament
as analogous to the houses of legislation
in the various governments of this country.
In our governments the chief magistrate has
only to execute definite and written laws and ordinances,
passed by the Legislature, and which
the Legislature may pass with or without his
consent; and when enacted, he must be governed
by them. Thus the president or the
governor is, in a certain sense, the agent and
officer of the legislative power of the state, to
carry into effect its decisions, and this <em>legislative</em>
power has really the control.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of Parliament.</div>

<p>By the ancient Constitution of England, however,
the Parliament was merely a body of
counselors, as it were, summoned by the king
to give him their advice, to frame for him such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
laws as he wanted to have framed, and to aid
him in raising funds by taxing the people.
The king might call this council or not, as he
pleased. There was no necessity for calling it
unless he needed more funds than he could
raise by his own resources. When called, they
felt that they had come, in a great measure, to
aid the king in doing his will. When they
framed a law, they sent it to him, and if he
was satisfied with it, he <em>made it law</em>. It was
the king who really enacted it. If he did not
approve the law, he wrote upon the parchment
which contained it, "The king will think of it,"
and that was the end. The king would call
upon them to assess a tax and collect the money,
and would talk to them about his plans,
and his government, and the aid which he
wanted from them to enable him to accomplish
what he had himself undertaken. In fact, the
king was the government, and the houses of
Parliament his instruments to aid him in giving
effect to his decrees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nobles.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The House of Commons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its humble position.</div>

<p>The nobles, that is, the heads of the great
families, and also the bishops, who were the
heads of the various dioceses of the Church,
formed one branch of this great council. This
was called the House of Lords. Certain representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the counties and of the towns
formed another branch, called the House of
Commons. These delegates came to the council,
not from any right which the counties and
towns were supposed to possess to a share in
the government, but simply because they were
summoned by the king to come and give him
their aid. They were to serve without pay, as
a matter of duty which they owed to the sovereign.
Those that came from counties were
called knights, and those from the towns burgesses.
These last were held in very little estimation.
The towns, in those days, were considered
as mere collections of shopkeepers and
tradesmen, who were looked down upon with
much disdain by the haughty nobles. When
the king called his Parliament together, and
went in to address them, he entered the chamber
of the House of Peers, and the commons
were called in, to stand where they could, with
their heads uncovered, to hear what he had to
say. They were, in a thousand other ways,
treated as an inferior class; but still their counsels
might, in some cases, be of service, and so
they were summoned to attend, though they
were to meet always, and deliberate, in a separate
chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's power over Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His responsibility.</div>

<p>As the king could call the Parliament together
at any time and place he pleased, so he
could suspend or terminate their sittings at any
time. He could intermit the action of a Parliament
for a time, sending the members to
their homes until he should summon them
again. This was called a <em>prorogation</em>. Or
he could dissolve the body entirely at any
time, and then require new elections for a
new Parliament whenever he wanted to avail
himself of the wisdom or aid of such a body
again.</p>

<p>Thus every thing went on the supposition
that the real responsibility for the government
was with the king. He was the monarch, and
the real sovereignty vested in him. He called
his nobles, and a delegation from the mass of
the people, together, whenever he wanted their
help, and not otherwise. He was responsible,
not to them nor to the people at large, but to
God only, for the acts of his administration.
The duty of Parliament was limited to that of
aiding him in carrying out his plans of government,
and the people had nothing to do but
to be obedient, submissive, and loyal. These
were, at any rate, the ideas of the kings, and
all the forms of the English Constitution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the ancient phraseology in which the transactions
are expressed, correspond with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An illustration.</div>

<div class="sidenote">James's message to Parliament.</div>

<p>We can not give a better proof and illustration
of what has been said than by transcribing
the substance of one of King James's messages
to his Parliament, delivered about the
close of his life, and, of course, at the period of
which we are writing. It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My Lords spiritual and temporal, and you the Commons:
In my last Parliament I made long discourses, especially to
them of the Lower House. I did open the true thought of my
heart. But I may say with our Savior, 'I have piped to you
and ye have not danced; I have mourned to you and you
have not lamented;' so all my sayings turned to me again
without any success. And now, to tell the reasons of your
calling and of this meeting, apply it to yourselves, and spend
not the time in long speeches. Consider that the Parliament
is a thing composed of a head and a body; the monarch and
the two estates. It was, first, a monarchy; then, after, a Parliament.
There are no Parliaments but in monarchical governments;
for in Venice, the Netherlands, and other free
governments there are none. The head is to call the body
together; and for the clergy the bishops are chief, for shires
their knights, for towns and cities their burgesses and citizens.
These are to treat of difficult matters, and counsel
their king with their best advice to make laws<a name="fnanchor_1_1" id="fnanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#fnanchor_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for the commonweal;
and the Lower House is also to petition the king
and acquaint him with their grievances, and not to meddle
with the king's prerogative. They are to offer supply for
his necessity, and he to distribute, in recompense thereof,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>justice and mercy. As in all Parliaments it is the <em>king's</em> office
to make good laws, whose fundamental cause is the people's
ill manners, so at this time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#fnanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Meaning advice to him how he shall make laws, as is evident from
what is said below.</p></div>

<p>"For a supply to my necessities, I have reigned eighteen
years, in which I have had peace, and I have received far
less supply than hath been given to any king since the Conquest.
The last queen had, one year with another, above a
hundred thousand pounds per annum in subsidies; and in all
my time I have had but four subsidies and six fifteens.<a name="fnanchor_2_2" id="fnanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It
is ten years since I had a subsidy, in all which time I have
been sparing to trouble you. I have turned myself as nearly
to save expenses as I may. I have abated much in my
household expenses, in my navies, and the charge of my munition."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#fnanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>Species of taxes granted by Parliament.
</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">James's message to Parliament.</div>

<p>After speaking about the affairs of the Palatinate,
and calling upon the Parliament to
furnish him with money to recover it for his
son-in-law, he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Consider the trade for the making thereof better, and
show me the reason why my mint, these eight or nine years,
hath not gone. I confess I have been liberal in my grants;
but if I be informed, I will amend all hurtful grievances.
But whoever shall hasten after grievances, and desire to make
himself popular, he hath the spirit of Satan. I was, in my
first Parliament, a novice; and in my last, there was a kind
of beasts, called <em>undertakers</em>, a dozen of whom undertook to
govern the last Parliament, and they led me. I shall thank
you for your good office, and desire that the world may say
well of our agreement."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Its high tone.</div>

<p>This kind of harangue from the king to his
Parliament seems not to have been considered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>at the time, at all extraordinary; though, if
such a message were to be sent, at the present
day, by a President of the United States to the
houses of Congress, we think it would make a
sensation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Privileges of the House of Commons.</div>

<p>Still, notwithstanding what we have said,
the Parliament did contrive gradually to attain
to the possession of some privileges and powers
of its own. The English people have a great
deal of independence and spirit, though Americans
traveling there, with ideas carried from
this country, are generally surprised at finding
so little instead of so much. The knights and
burgesses of the House of Commons, though
they submitted patiently to the forms of degradation
which the lords and kings imposed upon
them, gradually got possession of certain powers
which they claimed as their own, and which
they showed a strong disposition to defend.
They claimed the exclusive right to lay taxes
of every kind. This had been the usage so
long, that they had the same right to it that
the king had to his crown. They had a right,
too, to petition the king for a redress of any
grievances which they supposed the people
were suffering under his reign. These, and
certain other powers and immunities which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
they had possessed, were called their <em>privileges</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's prerogatives.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles's contest with Parliament.</div>

<p>The king's rights were, on the other hand,
called his <em>prerogatives</em>. The Parliament were
always endeavoring to extend, define, and establish
their privileges. The king was equally
bent on maintaining his ancient prerogatives.
King Charles's reign derives its chief interest
from the long and insane contest which he
waged with his Parliament on this question.
The contest commenced at the king's accession
to the throne, and lasted a quarter of a century:
it ended with his losing all his prerogatives
and his head.</p>

<p>This circumstance, that the main interest in
King Charles's reign is derived from his contest
with his Parliament, has made it necessary
to explain somewhat fully, as we have done,
the nature of that body. We have described it
as it was in the days of the Stuarts; but, in
order not to leave any wrong impression on the
mind of the reader in regard to its present condition,
we must add, that though all its external
forms remain the same, the powers and
functions of the body have greatly changed.
The despised and contemned knights and burgesses,
that were not worthy to have seats provided
for them when the king was delivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
them his speech, now rule the world; or, at
least, come nearer to the possession of that dominion
than any other power has ever done, in
ancient or modern times. They decide who
shall administer the government, and in what
way. They make the laws, settle questions
of trade and commerce, decide really on peace
and war, and, in a word, hold the whole control,
while the nominal sovereign takes rides
in the royal parks, or holds drawing-rooms in
the palaces, in empty and powerless parade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Present condition of the Commons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its vast influence.</div>

<p>There is no question that the British House of
Commons has exerted a far wider influence on
the destinies of the human race than any other
governmental power that has ever existed. It
has gone steadily on for five, and perhaps for
ten centuries, in the same direction and toward
the same ends; and whatever revolutions may
threaten other elements of European power,
the British House of Commons, in some form
or other, is as sure as any thing human can be
of existence and power for five or ten centuries
to come.</p>

<p>And yet it is one of the most remarkable of
the strange phenomena of social life, that this
body, standing at the head, as it really does,
of all human power, submits patiently still to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
all the marks and tokens of inferiority and degradation
which accompanied its origin. It
comes together when the sovereign sends writs,
<em>ordering</em> the several constituencies to choose
their representatives, and the representatives to
assemble. It comes humbly into the House of
Peers to listen to the instructions of the sovereign
at the opening of the session, the members
in a standing position, and with heads uncovered.<a name="fnanchor_3_3" id="fnanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
It debates these suggestions with
forms and in a phraseology which imply that
it is only considering what <em>counsel</em> to give the
king. It enacts nothing&mdash;it only recommends;
and it holds its existence solely at the discretion
of the great imaginary power which called
it into being. These forms may, very probably,
soon be changed for others more true to
the facts; and the principle of election may be
changed, so as to make the body represent more
fully the general population of the empire; but
the body itself will doubtless continue its action
for a very long period to come.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="footnote_3_3" id="footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#fnanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Even in the case of a committee of conference between the two
houses, the lords have <em>seats</em> in the committee-room, and wear their
hats. The members from the commons must <em>stand</em>, and be uncovered
during the deliberations.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Old forms still retained.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Will probably be changed.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of a demise of the crown.</div>

<div class="sidenote">All offices expire.</div>

<p>According to the view of the subject which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>we have presented, it would of course follow,
as the real sovereignty was mainly in the king's
hands, that at the death of one monarch and
the accession of another, the functions of all
officers holding their places under the authority
of the former would expire. This was actually
the case. And it shows how entirely the Parliament
was considered as the instrument and
creation of the king, that on the death of a king,
the Parliament immediately expired. The new
monarch must make a new Parliament if he
wished one to help him carry out his own plans.
In the same manner almost all other offices expired.
As it would be extremely inconvenient
or impossible to appoint anew all the officers
of such a realm on a sudden emergency, it is
usual for the king to issue a decree renewing
the appointments of the existing incumbents of
these offices. Thus King Charles, two days
after his father's death, made it his first act to
renew the appointments of the members of his
father's privy council, of the foreign embassadors,
and of the judges of the courts, in order
that the affairs of the empire might go on without
interruption. He also issued summonses
for calling a Parliament, and then made arrangements
for the solemnization of his father's
funeral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Westminster.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Strand.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Temple Bar.</div>

<p>The scene of these transactions was what
was, in those days, called Westminster. Minster
means cathedral. A cathedral church had
been built, and an abbey founded, at a short
distance west from London, near the mouth of
the Thames. The church was called the West
<em>minster</em>, and the abbey, Westminster Abbey.
The town afterward took the same name. The
street leading to the city of London from Westminster
was called the Strand; it lay along the
shore of the river. The gate by which the city
of London was entered on this side was called
Temple Bar, on account of a building just
within the walls, at that point, which was called
the Temple. In process of time, London expanded
beyond its bounds and spread westward.
The Strand became a magnificent street of
shops and stores. Westminster was filled with
palaces and houses of the nobility, the whole
region being entirely covered with streets and
edifices of the greatest magnificence and splendor.
Westminster is now called the West End
of London, though the jurisdiction of the city
still ends at Temple Bar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Somerset House.</div>

<p>Parliament held its sessions in a building
near the shore, called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen's. The king's
palace, called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James's Palace, was near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The old church became a place of sepulture for
the English kings, where a long line of them
now repose. The palace of King James's wife,
Anne of Denmark, was on the bank of the river,
some distance down the Strand. She called it,
during her life, Denmark House, in honor of
her native land. Its name is now Somerset
House.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James's funeral.</div>

<p>King James's funeral was attended with
great pomp. The body was conveyed from
Somerset House to its place of repose in the
Abbey, and attended by a great procession.
King Charles walked as chief mourner. Two
earls attended him, one on each side, and the
train of his robes was borne by twelve peers
of the realm. The expenses of this funeral
amounted to a sum equal to two hundred thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>One thing more is to be stated before we
can consider Charles as fairly entered upon his
career, and that is the circumstance of his marriage.
His father James, so soon as he found
the negotiations with Spain must be finally
abandoned, opened a new negotiation with the
King of France for his daughter Henrietta
Maria. After some delay, this arrangement
was concluded upon. The treaty of marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was made, and soon after the old king's death,
Charles began to think of bringing home his
bride.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage of Charles.</div>

<p>He accordingly made out a commission for a
nobleman, appointed for the purpose, to act in
his name, in the performance of the ceremony
at Paris. The pope's dispensation was obtained,
Henrietta Maria, as well as the Infanta,
being a Catholic. The ceremony was performed,
as such ceremonies usually were in Paris,
in the famous church of Nôtre Dame, where
Charles's grandmother, Mary Queen of Scots,
had been married to a prince of France about
seventy years before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imposing ceremonies.</div>

<p>There was a great theater, or platform, erected
in front of the altar in the church, which
was thronged by the concourse of spectators
who rushed to witness the ceremony. The
beautiful princess was married by proxy to a
man in another kingdom, whom she had never
seen, or, at least, never known. It is not
probable that she observed him at the time
when he was, for one evening, in her presence,
on his journey through Paris. The Duke of
Buckingham had been sent over by Charles to
conduct home his bride. Ships were waiting
at Boulogne, a port nearly opposite to Dover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to take her and her attendants on board. She
bade farewell to the palaces of Paris, and set
out on her journey.<a name="fnanchor_4_4" id="fnanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#fnanchor_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of the bride at London.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Her residence.</div>

<p>The king, in the mean time, had gone to
Dover, where he awaited her arrival. She
landed at Dover on the day after sailing from
Boulogne, sea-sick and sad. The king received
his bride, and with their attendants they went
by carriages to Canterbury, and on the following
day they entered London. Great preparations
had been made for receiving the king and
his consort in a suitable manner; but London
was, at this time, in a state of great distress
and fear on account of the plague which had
broken out there. The disease had increased
during the king's absence, and the alarm and
anxiety were so great, that the rejoicings on
account of the arrival of the queen were omitted.
She journeyed quietly, therefore, to Westminster,
and took up her abode at Somerset
House, which had been the residence of her
predecessor. They had fitted it up for her reception,
providing for it, among other conveniences,
a Roman Catholic chapel, where she
could enjoy the services of religion in the forms
to which she had been accustomed.</p>

years. It will assist the reader to receive and
retain in mind a clear idea of the course of
events during his reign, if we regard it as divided
into three periods. During the first,
which continued about four years, Charles and
the Parliament were both upon the stage, contending
with each other, but not at open war.
Each party managed, and maneuvered, and
struggled to gain its own ends, the disagreement
widening and deepening continually, till it
ended in an open rupture, when Charles abandoned
the plan of having Parliaments at all,
and attempted to govern alone. This attempt
to manage the empire without a legislature
lasted for ten years, and is the second period.
After this a Parliament was called, and it soon
made itself independent of the king, and became
hostile to him, the two powers being at
open war, which constitutes the third period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Thus we have four years spent in getting into
the quarrel between the king and Parliament,
ten years in an attempt by the king to govern
alone, and, finally, ten years of war, more or
less open, the king on one side, and the Parliament
on the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leading events of his reign.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His influence over the king.</div>

<p>The first four years&mdash;that is, the time spent
in getting really into the quarrel with Parliament,
was Buckingham's work, for during that
time Buckingham's influence with the king
was paramount and supreme; and whatever
was done that was important or extraordinary,
though done in the king's name, really originated
in him. The whole country knew this,
and were indignant that such a man, so unprincipled,
so low in character, so reckless, and
so completely under the sway of his impulses
and passions, should have such an influence
over the king, and, through him, such power to
interfere with and endanger the mighty interests
of so vast a realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General system of government.</div>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, in consequence
of what has been said about the extent
of the regal power in England, that the daily
care and responsibility of the affairs of government,
in its ordinary administration, rested directly
upon the king. It is not possible that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
any one mind can even comprehend, far less direct,
such an enormous complication of interests
and of action as is involved in the carrying
on, from day to day, the government of an
empire. Offices, authorities, and departments
of administration spring up gradually, and all
the ordinary routine of the affairs of the empire
are managed by them. Thus the navy was all
completely organized, with its gradations of
rank, its rules of action, its records, its account
books, its offices and arrangements for provisionment
and supply, the whole forming a vast
system which moved on of itself, whether the
king were present or absent, sick or well, living
or dead. It was so with the army; it was so
with the courts; it was so with the general administration
of the government at London.
The immense mass of business which constituted
the work of government was all systematized
and arranged, and it moved on regularly,
in the hands of more or less prudent and
careful men, who governed, themselves, by ancient
rules and usages, and in most cases managed
wisely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His majesty.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Every thing done in the king's name.</div>

<p>Every thing, however, was done in the king's
<em>name</em>. The ships were his majesty's ships,
the admirals were his majesty's servants, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
war was his majesty's war, the court was the
<em>King's</em> Bench. The idea was, that all these
thousands of officers, of all ranks and grades,
were only an enormous multiplication of his
majesty; that they might do his will and carry
on his administration as he would himself carry
it on were he personally capable of attending to
such a vast detail; subject, of course, to certain
limits and restrictions which the laws and
customs of the realm, and the promises and
contracts of his predecessors, had imposed. But
although all this action was theoretically the
king's action, it came to be, in fact, almost
wholly independent of him. It went on of itself,
in a regular and systematic way, pursuing
its own accustomed course, except so far as the
king directly interposed to modify its action.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that the king would
certainly take <em>the general direction</em> of affairs
into his own hands, and that this charge, at
least, would necessarily come upon him, as
king, day by day. Some monarchs have attempted
to do this, but it is obvious that there
must be some provision for having this general
charge, as well as all the subordinate functions
of government, attended to independently of the
king, as his being always in a condition to fulfill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this duty is not to be relied upon. Sometimes
the king is young and inexperienced;
sometimes he is sick or absent; and sometimes
he is too feeble in mind, or too indolent,
or too devoted to his pleasures to exercise any
governmental care. There has gradually grown
up, therefore, in all monarchies, the custom of
having a central board of officers of state, whom
the king appoints, and who take the general
direction of affairs off his mind, except so far as
he chooses to interfere. This board, in England,
is called the Privy Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Privy Council.</div>

<div class="sidenote">It represents the king.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Constitution and functions of the Privy Council.</div>

<p>The Privy Council in England is a body of
great importance. Its nature and its functions
are, of course, entirely different from those of
the two houses of Parliament. <em>They</em> represent,
or are intended to represent, the nation.
The Parliament is, in theory, the nation, assembled
at the king's command, to give him
their advice. The Privy Council, on the other
hand, represents the king. It is the king's
Privy Council. They act in his name. They
follow his directions when he chooses to give
any. Whatever they decide upon and decree,
the king signs&mdash;often, indeed, without any idea
of what it is; but he still signs it, and all such
decrees go forth to the world as the king's orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in council. The Privy Council, of course,
would have its meetings, its officers, its records,
its rules of proceeding, and its various usages,
and these grew, in time, to be laws and rights;
but still it was, in theory, only a sort of expansion
of the king, as if to make a kind of artificial
being, with one soul, but many heads and
hands, because no natural human being could
possibly have capacities and powers extensive
and multifarious enough for the exigencies of
reigning. Charles thus had a council who
went on with every thing, except so far as he
chose to interpose. The members were generally
able and experienced men. And yet
Buckingham was among them. He had been
made Lord High Admiral of England, which
gave him supreme command of the navy, and
admitted him to the Privy Council. These
were very high honors.</p>

<p>This Privy Council now took the direction
of public affairs, attended to every thing, provided
for all emergencies, and kept all the complicated
machinery of government in motion,
without the necessity of the king's having any
personal agency in the matter. The king
might interpose, more or less, as he was inclined;
and when he did interpose, he sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
found obstacles in the way of immediately accomplishing
his plans, in the forms or usages
which had gradually grown into laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Restrictions on the royal power.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A new Parliament.</div>

<p>For instance, when the king began his reign,
he was very eager to have the war for the recovery
of the Palatinate go on at once; and he
was, besides, very much embarrassed for want
of money. He wished, therefore, in order to
save time, that the old Parliament which King
James had called should continue to act under
his reign. But his Privy Council told him that
that could not be. That was <em>James's</em> Parliament.
If he wanted one for his reign, he must
call upon the people to elect a new Parliament
for him.</p>

<p>The new Parliament was called, and Charles
sent them a very civil message, explaining the
emergency which had induced him to call them,
and the reason why he was so much in want of
money. His father had left the government a
great deal in debt. There had been heavy expenses
connected with the death of the former
king, and with his own accession and marriage.
Then there was the war. It had been engaged
in by his father, with the approbation of the
former Parliament; and engagements had been
made with allies, which now they could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
honorably retract. He urged them, therefore,
to grant, without delay, the necessary supplies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new Parliament meets at Oxford.</div>

<p>The Parliament met in July, but the plague
was increasing in London, and they had to adjourn,
early in August, to Oxford. This city
is situated upon the Thames, and was then, as
it is now, the seat of a great many colleges.
These colleges were independent of each other
in their internal management, though united
together in one general system. The name of
one of them, which is still very distinguished,
was Christ Church College. They had, among
the buildings of that college, a magnificent hall,
more than one hundred feet long, and very lofty,
built in a very imposing style. It is still a
great object of interest to all who visit Oxford.
This hall was fitted up for the use of Parliament,
and the king met the two houses there,
and made a new speech himself, and had others
made by his ministers, explaining the state of
public affairs, and gently urging the houses to
act with promptness and decision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties commence between the king and Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Demands of Parliament, and the king's answers.</div>

<p>The houses then separated, and each commenced
its own deliberations. But, instead of
promptly complying with the king's proposals,
they sent him a petition for redress of a long
list of what they called grievances. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
grievances were, almost all of them, complaints
of the toleration and encouragement of the
Catholics, through the influence of the king's
Catholic bride. She had stipulated to have a
Catholic chapel, and Catholic attendants, and,
after her arrival in England, she and Buckingham
had so much influence over the king, that
they were producing quite a change at court,
and gradually through all ranks of society, in
favor of the Catholics. The Commons complained
of a great many things, nearly all, however,
originating in this cause. The king answered
these complaints, clause by clause, promising
redress more or less distinctly. There is
not room to give this petition and the answers
in full, but as all the subsequent troubles between
Charles and the people of England arose
out of this difficulty of his young wife's bringing
in so strong a Catholic influence with her
to the realm, it may be well to give an abstract
of some of the principal petitions, with the king's
answers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Commons said</p>

<p>That they had understood that popish priests,
and other Catholics, were gradually creeping in
as teachers of the youth of the realm, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>various seminaries of learning, and they wanted
to have decided measures taken to examine all
candidates for such stations, with a view to the
careful exclusion of all who were not true Protestants.</p>

<p><em>King.</em>&mdash;Allowed. And I will send to the
archbishops and all the authorities to see that
this is done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Commons.</em>&mdash;That more efficient arrangements
should be made for appointing able and
faithful men in the Church&mdash;men that will
really devote themselves to preaching the Gospel
to the people, instead of conferring these
places and salaries on favorites; sometimes, as
has been the case, several to the same man.</p>

<p>The king made some explanations in regard
to this subject, and promised hereafter to comply
with this requisition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Commons.</em>&mdash;That the laws against sending
children out of the country to foreign countries
to be educated in Catholic seminaries should
be strictly enforced, and the practice be entirely
broken up.</p>

<p><em>King.</em>&mdash;Agreed; and he would send to the
lord admiral, and to all the naval officers on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>the coast, to watch very carefully and stop all
children attempting to go abroad for such a
purpose; and he would issue a proclamation
commanding all the noblemen's children now
on the Continent to return by a given day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Commons.</em>&mdash;That no Catholic (or, as they
called him, popish <em>recusant</em>, that is, a person
<em>refusing</em> to subscribe to the Protestant faith,
<em>recusant</em> meaning <em>person refusing</em>) be admitted
into the king's service at court; and that
no <em>English</em> Catholic be admitted into the
queen's service. They could not refuse to allow
her to employ her own <em>French</em> attendants,
but to appoint English Catholics to the honorable
and lucrative offices at her disposal was
doing a great injury to the Protestant cause in
the realm.</p>

<p>The king agreed to this, with some conditions
and evasions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Commons.</em>&mdash;That all Jesuits and Catholic
priests, owing allegiance to the See of Rome,
should be sent away from the country, according
to laws already existing, after fair notice
given; and if they would not go, that they
should be imprisoned in such a manner as to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>kept from all communication with other persons,
so as not to disseminate their false religion.</p>

<p><em>King.</em>&mdash;The laws on this subject shall be
enforced.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The king and the Commons both in the wrong.</div>

<p>The above are sufficient for a specimen of
these complaints and of the king's answers.
There were many more of them, but they have
all the same character and end, namely, to stop
the strong current of Catholic influence and ascendency
which was setting in to the court,
and through the court into the realm, through
the influence of the young queen and the persons
connected with her. At the present day,
and in this country, the Commons will be
thought to be in the wrong, inasmuch as the
thing which they were contending against was,
in the main, merely the toleration of the Catholic
religion. But then the king was in the
wrong too, for, since the laws against this toleration
stood enacted by the consent and concurrence
of his predecessors, he should not have
allowed them to be infracted and virtually annulled
through the influence of a foreign bride
and an unworthy favorite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king promises every thing.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His insincerity.</div>

<p>Perhaps he felt that he was wrong, or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his answers were all framed for him by
his Privy Council. At all events, they were
entirely favorable to the demands of the Commons.
He promised every thing. In many
things he went even beyond their demands. It
is admitted, however, on all hands, that, so far
as he himself had any agency in making these
replies, he was not really sincere. He himself,
and Buckingham, were very eager to get supplies.
Buckingham was admiral of the fleet,
and had a great desire to enlarge the force at
his command, with a view to the performing of
some great exploit in the war. It is understood,
therefore, that the king intended his replies
as promises merely. At any rate, the
promises were made. The Commons were
called into the great hall again, at Christ
Church, where the Peers assembled, and the
king's answers were read to them. Buckingham
joined in this policy of attempting to conciliate
the Commons. He went into their assembly
and made a long speech, explaining and
justifying his conduct, and apologizing, in some
sense, for what might seem to be wrong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commons not satisfied.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament dissolved.</div>

<p>The Commons returned to their place of deliberation,
but they were not satisfied. They
wanted something besides promises. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
were in favor of granting supplies "in gratitude
to his majesty for his gracious answer."
Others thought differently. They did not see
the necessity for raising money for this foreign
war. They had greater enemies at home
(meaning Buckingham and popery) than they
had abroad. Besides, if the king would stop
his waste and extravagance in bestowing honors
and rewards, there would be money enough
for all necessary uses. In a word, there was
much debate, but nothing done. The king,
after a short time, sent a message to them urging
them to come to decision. They sent
him back a declaration which showed that they
did not intend to yield. Their language, however,
was of the most humble character. They
called him "their dread sovereign," and themselves
"his poor commons." The king was
displeased with them, and dissolved the Parliament.
They, of course, immediately became
private citizens, and dispersed to their homes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1628.</div>

<div class="sidenote">New one called.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Subterfuges of the king.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament again dissolved.</div>

<p>After trying some ineffectual attempts to raise
money by his own royal prerogatives and powers,
the king called a new Parliament, taking
some curious precautions to keep out of it such
persons as he thought would oppose his plans.
The Earl of Bristol, whom Buckingham had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
been so jealous of, considering him as his rival,
was an influential member of the House of
Peers. Charles and Buckingham agreed to
omit him in sending out the royal writs to
summon the peers. He petitioned Parliament,
claiming a right to his seat. Charles then sent
him his writ, but gave him a command, as his
sovereign, not to attend the session. He also
selected four of the prominent men in the House
of Commons, men whom he considered most
influential in opposition to him and to Buckingham,
and appointed them to offices which
would call them away from London; and as it
was the understanding in those days that the
sovereign had a right to command the services
of his subjects, they were obliged to go. The
king hoped, by these and similar means, to diminish
the influence against him in Parliament,
and to get a majority in his favor. But his
plans did not succeed. Such measures only
irritated the House and the country. After
another struggle, this Parliament was dissolved
too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The breach between the king and the Parliament widens.</div>

<p>Things went on so for four or five years, the
breach between the king and the people growing
wider and wider. Within this time there
were four Parliaments called, and, after various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
contentions with them, they were, one after another,
dissolved. The original subject of disagreement,
viz., the growing influence of the
Catholics, was not the only one. Other points
came up, growing out of the king's use of his prerogative,
and his irregular and, as they thought,
illegal attempts to interfere with their freedom
of action. The king, or, rather, Buckingham
using the king's name, resorted to all sorts of
contrivances to accomplish this object. For
instance, it had long been the custom, in case
any member of the House of Peers was absent,
for him to give authority to any friend of his,
who was also a member, to vote for him. This
authority was called a <em>proxy</em>. This word is
supposed to be derived from <em>procuracy</em>, which
means action in the place of, and in behalf of,
another. Buckingham induced a great number
of the peers to give him their proxies. He
did this by rewards, honors, and various other
influences, and he found so many willing to
yield to these inducements, that at one time he
had thirty or forty proxies in his hands. Thus,
on a question arising in the House of Lords, he
could give a very large majority of votes. The
House, after murmuring for some time, and expressing
much discontent and vexation at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
state of things, finally made a law that no member
of the House should ever have power to use
more than <em>two</em> proxies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impeachment of Buckingham.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king interferes.</div>

<p>One of the Parliaments which King Charles
assembled at length brought articles of impeachment
against Buckingham, and a long contest
arose on this subject. An impeachment is a
trial of a high officer of state for maladministration
of his office. All sorts of charges were
brought against Buckingham, most of which
were true. The king considered their interfering
to call one of his ministers to account as
wholly intolerable. He sent them orders to dismiss
that subject from their deliberations, and
to proceed immediately with their work of laying
taxes to raise money, or he would dissolve
the Parliament as he had done before. He reminded
them that the Parliaments were entirely
"in his power for their calling, sitting, and dissolution,
and as he found their fruits were for
good or evil, so they were to continue, or not to
be." If they would mend their errors and do
their duty, henceforward he would forgive the
past; otherwise they were to expect his irreconcilable
hostility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another dissolution.</div>

<p>This language irritated instead of alarming
them. The Commons persisted in their plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of impeachment. The king arrested the men
whom they appointed as managers of the impeachment,
and imprisoned them. The Commons
remonstrated, and insisted that Buckingham
should be dismissed from the king's service.
The king, instead of dismissing him, took
measures to have him appointed, in addition to
all his other offices, Chancellor of the University
of Cambridge, a very exalted station. Parliament
remonstrated. The king, in retaliation,
dissolved the Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's reckless conduct.</div>

<p>Thus things went on from bad to worse, and
from worse to worse again; the chief cause of
the difficulties, in almost all cases, being traceable
to Buckingham's reckless and arbitrary
conduct. He was continually doing something
in the pursuit of his own ends, by the rash and
heedless exercise of the vast powers committed
to him, to make extensive and irreparable mischief.
At one time he ordered a part of the
fleet over to the coast of France, to enter the
French service, the sailors expecting that they
were to be employed against the Spaniards.
They found, however, that, instead of going
against the Spaniards, they were to be sent to
Rochelle. Rochelle was a town in France in
possession of the Protestants, and the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
France wanted to subdue them. The sailors
sent a remonstrance to their commander, begging
not to be forced to fight against their
brother Protestants. This remonstrance was,
in form, what is called a <em>Round Robin</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Round Robin.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Return of the English fleet.</div>

<p>In a Round Robin a circle is drawn, the petition
or remonstrance is written within it, and
the names are written all around it, to prevent
any one's having to take the responsibility of
being the first signer. When the commander
of the fleet received the Round Robin, instead
of being offended, he inquired into the facts,
and finding that the case was really as the
Round Robin represented it, he broke away
from the French command and returned to England.
He said he would rather be hanged in
England for disobeying orders than to fight
against the Protestants of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The officers and men desert.</div>

<p>Buckingham might have known that such a
spirit as this in Englishmen was not to be trifled
with. But he knew nothing, and thought
of nothing, except that he wanted to please and
gratify the French government. When the
fleet, therefore, arrived in England, he peremptorily
ordered it back, and he resorted to all
sorts of pretexts and misrepresentations of the
facts to persuade the officers and men that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
were not to be employed against the Protestants.
The fleet accordingly went back, and
when they arrived, they found that Buckingham
had deceived them. They were ordered
to Rochelle. One of the ships broke away and
returned to England. The officers and men
deserted from the other ships and got home.
The whole armament was disorganized, and the
English people, who took sides with the sailors,
were extremely exasperated against Buckingham
for his blind and blundering recklessness,
and against the king for giving such a man the
power to do his mischief on such an extensive
scale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition to Spain.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's egregious folly.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The expedition ends in disaster.</div>

<p>At another time the duke and the king contrived
to fit out a fleet of eighty sail to make a
descent upon the coast of Spain. It caused
them great trouble to get the funds for this expedition,
as they had to collect them, in a great
measure, by various methods depending on the
king's prerogative, and not by authority of Parliament.
Thus the whole country were dissatisfied
and discontented in respect to the fleet
before it was ready to sail. Then, as if this
was not enough, Buckingham overlooked all the
officers in the navy in selecting a commander,
and put an officer of the army in charge of it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a man whose whole experience had been acquired
in wars on the land. The country
thought that Buckingham ought to have taken
the command himself, as lord high admiral;
and if not, that he ought to have selected his
commander from the ranks of the service employed.
Thus the fleet set off on the expedition,
all on board burning with indignation
against the arbitrary and absurd management
of the favorite. The result of the expedition
was also extremely disastrous. They had an
excellent opportunity to attack a number of
ships, which would have made a very rich prize;
but the soldier-commander either did not know,
or did not dare to do, his duty. He finally,
however, effected a landing, and took a castle,
but the sailors found a great store of wine there,
and went to drinking and carousing, breaking
through all discipline. The commander had to
get them on board again immediately, and come
away. Then he conceived the plan of going to
intercept what were called the Spanish galleons,
which were ships employed to bring home silver
from the mines in America, which the Spaniards
then possessed. On further thoughts he
concluded to give up this idea, on account of
the plague, which, as he said, broke out in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
ships. So he came back to England with his
fleet disorganized, demoralized, and crippled,
and covered with military disgrace. The people
of England charged all this to Buckingham.
Still the king persisted in retaining him. It
was his prerogative to do so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's quarrel with Richelieu.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He resolves on war.</div>

<p>After a while Buckingham got into a personal
quarrel with Richelieu, who was the leading
manager of the French government, and he
resolved that England should make war upon
France. To alter the whole political position of
such an empire as that of Great Britain, in
respect to peace and war, and to change such a
nation as France from a friend to an enemy,
would seem to be quite an undertaking for a
single man to attempt, and that, too, without
having any reason whatever to assign, except a
personal quarrel with a minister about a love affair.
But so it was. Buckingham undertook
it. It was the king's prerogative to make peace
or war, and Buckingham ruled the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French servants dismissed.</div>

<div class="sidenote">War declared against France.</div>

<p>He contrived various ways of fomenting ill
will. One was, to alienate the mind of the king
from the queen. He represented to him that
the queen's French servants were getting to be
very disrespectful and insolent in their treatment
of him, and finally persuaded him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
send them all home. So the king went one
day to Somerset House, which was the queen's
residence&mdash;for it is often the custom in high
life in Europe for the husband and wife to
have separate establishments&mdash;and requested
her to summon her French servants into his
presence, and when they were assembled, he
told them that he had concluded to send them
all home to France. Some of them, he said,
had acted properly enough, but others had been
rude and forward, and that he had concluded it
best to send them all home. The French king,
on hearing of this, seized a hundred and twenty
English ships lying in his harbors in retaliation
of this act, which he said was a palpable violation
of the marriage contract, as it certainly
was. Upon this the king declared war against
France. He did not ask Parliament to act in
this case at all. There was no Parliament.
Parliament had been dissolved in a fit of displeasure.
The whole affair was an exercise of
the royal prerogative. He did not dare to call
a Parliament to provide means for carrying on
the war, but set his Privy Council to devise
modes of doing it, through this same prerogative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition to France abortive.</div>

<p>The attempts to raise money in these ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
made great trouble. The people resisted, and
interposed all possible difficulties. However,
some funds were raised, and a fleet of a hundred
sail, and an army of seven thousand men,
were got together. Buckingham undertook the
command of this expedition himself, as there
had been so much dissatisfaction with his appointment
of a commander to the other. It
resulted just as was to be expected in the case
of seven thousand men, and a hundred ships,
afloat on the swelling surges of the English
Channel, under the command of vanity, recklessness,
and folly. The duke came back to
England in three months, bringing home one
third of his force. The rest had been lost, without
accomplishing any thing. The measure of
public indignation against Buckingham was
now full.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another projected.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1628.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Assassination of Buckingham.</div>

<p>Buckingham himself walked as loftily and
proudly as ever. He got up another fleet, and
was preparing to set sail in it himself, as commander
again. He went to Portsmouth, accordingly,
for this purpose, Portsmouth being
the great naval station then, as now, on the
southern coast of England. Here a man named
Felton, who had been an officer under the duke
in the former expedition, and who had been extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
exasperated against him on account of
some of his management there, and who had
since found how universal was the detestation
of him in England, resolved to rid the country
of such a curse at once. He accordingly took
his station in the passage-way of the house
where Buckingham was, armed with a knife.
Buckingham came out, talking with some
Frenchmen in an angry manner, having had
some dispute with them, and Felton thrust the
knife into his side as he passed, and, leaving it
in the wound, walked away, no one having
noticed who did the deed. Buckingham pulled
out the knife, fell down, and died. The bystanders
were going to seize one of the Frenchmen,
when Felton advanced and said, "I am
the man who did the deed; let no man suffer
that is innocent." He was taken. They found
a paper in his hat, saying that he was going to
destroy the duke, and that he could not sacrifice
his life in a nobler cause than by delivering
his country from so great an enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king not sorry.</div>

<p>King Charles was four miles off at this time.
They carried him the news. He did not appear
at all concerned or troubled, but only directed
that the murderer&mdash;he ought to have
said, perhaps, the <em>executioner</em>&mdash;should be secured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and that the fleet should proceed to sail.
He also ordered the treasurer to make arrangements
for a splendid funeral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckingham's monument the universal execration of his countrymen.</div>

<p>The treasurer said, in reply, that a funeral
would only be a temporary show, and that he
could hereafter erect a <em>monument</em> at half the
cost, which would be a much more lasting memorial.
Charles acceded. Afterward, when
Charles spoke to him about the monument, the
treasurer replied, What would the world say if
your majesty were to build a monument to the
duke before you erect one for your father? So
the plan was abandoned, and Buckingham had
no other monument than the universal detestation
of his countrymen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty in raising funds.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">T</span>HE great difficulty in governing without
a Parliament was how to raise funds. By
the old customs and laws of the realm, a tax
upon the people could only be levied by the action
of the House of Commons; and the great
object of the king and council during Buckingham's
life, in summoning Parliaments from
time to time, was to get their aid in this point.
But as Charles found that one Parliament after
another withheld the grants, and spent their
time in complaining of his government, he
would dissolve them, successively, after exhausting
all possible means of bringing them to
a compliance with his will. He would then be
thrown upon his own resources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's resources.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Modes of raising money.</div>

<p>The king had <em>some</em> resources of his own.
These were certain estates, and lands, and
other property, in various parts of the country,
which belonged to the crown, the income of
which the king could appropriate. But the
amount which could be derived from this source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was very small. Then there were certain other
modes of raising money, which had been resorted
to by former monarchs, in emergencies, at
distant intervals, but still in instances so numerous
that the king considered precedents
enough had been established to make the power
to resort to these modes a part of the prerogative
of the crown. The people, however, considered
these acts of former monarchs as irregularities
or usurpations. They denied the
king's right to resort to these methods, and
they threw so many difficulties in the way of
the execution of his plans, that finally he would
call another Parliament, and make new efforts
to lead them to conform to his will. The more
the experiment was tried, however, the worse
it succeeded; and at last the king determined
to give up the idea of Parliaments altogether,
and to compel the people to submit to his plans
of raising money without them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliaments abandoned.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The government attaches the property of a member of Parliament.</div>

<p>The final dissolution of Parliament, by which
Charles entered upon his new plan of government,
was attended with some resistance, and
the affair made great difficulty. It seems that
one of the members, a certain Mr. Rolls, had
had some of his goods seized for payment of
some of the king's irregular taxes, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
had refused to pay willingly. Now it had always
been considered the law of the land in
England, that the person and the property of a
member of Parliament were sacred during the
session, on the ground that while he was giving
his attendance at a council meeting called by
his sovereign, he ought to be protected from
molestation on the part either of his fellow-subjects
or his sovereign, in his person and in his
property. The House of Commons considered,
therefore, the seizure of the goods of one of the
members of the body as a breach of their privilege,
and took up the subject with a view to
punish the officers who acted. The king sent
a message immediately to the House, while
they were debating the subject, saying that the
officer acted, in seizing the goods, in obedience
to his own direct command. This produced
great excitement and long debates. The king,
by taking the responsibility of the seizure upon
himself, seemed to bid the House defiance.
They brought up this question: "Whether the
seizing of Mr. Rolls's goods was not a breach
of privilege?" When the time came for a decision,
the speaker, that is, the presiding officer,
refused to put the question to vote. He said
he had been commanded <em>by the king</em> not to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
it! The House were indignant, and immediately
adjourned for two days, probably for the
purpose of considering, and perhaps consulting
their constituents on what they were to do in so
extraordinary an emergency as the king's coming
into their own body and interfering with the
functions of one of their own proper officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion in the House of Commons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Resolutions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Commons refuse to admit the king's officers.</div>

<p>They met on the day to which they had adjourned,
prepared to insist on the speaker's
putting the question. But he, immediately on
the House coming to order, said that he had received
the king's command to adjourn the
House for a week, and to put no question whatever.
He then was going to leave the chair,
but two of the members advanced to him and
held him in his place, while they read some resolutions
which had been prepared. There was
great confusion and clamor. Some insisted that
the House was adjourned, some were determined
to pass the resolutions. The resolutions
were very decided. They declared that whoever
should counsel or advise the laying of taxes
not granted by Parliament, or be an actor or
instrument in collecting them, should be accounted
an innovator, and a capital enemy to
the kingdom and Commonwealth. And also,
that if any person whatever should voluntarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
pay such taxes, he should be counted a capital
enemy also. These resolutions were read in
the midst of great uproar. The king was informed
of the facts, and sent for the sergeant
of the House&mdash;one of the highest officers&mdash;but
the members locked the door, and would not
let the sergeant go. Then the king sent one
of his own officers to the House with a message.
The members kept the door locked, and
would not let him in until they had disposed of
the resolutions. Then the House adjourned for
a week.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Members imprisoned.</div>

<p>The next day, several of the leading members
who were supposed to have been active in these
proceedings were summoned to appear before
the council. They refused to answer out of
Parliament for what was said and done by
them in Parliament. The council sent them
to prison in the Tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissolution of Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king in the House of Lords.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's speech on dissolving Parliament.</div>

<p>The week passed away, and the time for the
reassembling of the Houses arrived. It had
been known, during the week, that the king
had determined on dissolving Parliament. It
is usual, in dissolving a Parliament, for the sovereign
not to appear in person, but to send his
message of dissolution by some person commissioned
to deliver it. This is called dissolving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the House by commission. The dissolution is
always declared in the House of Lords, the
Commons being summoned to attend. In this
case, however, the king attended in person.
He was dressed magnificently in his royal
robes, and wore his crown. He would not
deign, however, to send for the Commons. He
entered the House of Peers, and took his seat
upon the throne. Several of the Commons,
however, came in of their own accord, and stood
below the bar, at the usual place assigned them.
The king then rose and read the following
speech. The antiquity of the language gives
it an air of quaintness now which it did not
possess then.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My Lords,&mdash;I never came here upon so unpleasant
an occasion, it being the Dissolution of
a Parliament. Therefore Men may have some
cause to wonder why I should not rather chuse
to do this by Commission, it being a general
Maxim of Kings to leave harsh Commands to
their Ministers, Themselves only executing
pleasing things. Yet considering that Justice
as well consists in Reward and Praise of Virtue
as Punishing of Vice, I thought it necessary
to come here to-day, and to declare to you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>and all the World, that it was merely the undutiful
and seditious Carriage in the Lower
House that hath made the Dissolution of this
Parliament. And you, my Lords, are so far
from being any Causers of it, that I take as
much comfort in your dutiful Demeanour, as
I am justly distasted with their Proceedings.
Yet, to avoid their Mistakings, let me tell you,
that it is so far from me to adjudge all the
House alike guilty, that I know there are many
there as dutiful subjects as any in the World;
it being but some few Vipers among them that
did cast this Mist of Undutifulness over most
of their Eyes. Yet to say Truth, there was a
good Number there that could not be infected
with this Contagion.</p>

<p>"To conclude, As those Vipers must look
for their Reward of Punishment, so you, my
Lords, may justly expect from me that Favor
and Protection that a good King oweth to his
loving and faithful Nobility. And now, my
Lord Keeper, do what I have commanded you."</p></div>

<p>Then the lord keeper pronounced the Parliament
dissolved. The lord keeper was the
keeper of the great seal, one of the highest officers
of the crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king resolves to do without Parliaments.</div>

<p>Of course this affair produced a fever of excitement
against the king throughout the whole
realm. This excitement was kept up and increased
by the trials of the members of Parliament
who had been imprisoned. The courts
decided against them, and they were sentenced
to long imprisonment and to heavy fines. The
king now determined to do without Parliaments
entirely; and, of course, he had to raise money
by his royal prerogative altogether, as he had
done, in fact, before, a great deal, during the
intervals between the successive Parliaments.
It will not be very entertaining, but it will be
very useful to the reader to peruse carefully
some account of the principal methods resorted
to by the king. In order, however, to diminish
the necessity for money as much as possible,
the king prepared to make peace with France
and Spain; and as they, as well as England,
were exhausted with the wars, this was readily
effected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1630.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Forced loans.</div>

<p>One of the resorts adopted by the king was
to a system of <em>loans</em>, as they were called,
though these loans differed from those made by
governments at the present day, in being apportioned
upon the whole community according to
their liability to taxation, and in being made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in some respects, compulsory. The loan was
not to be absolutely collected by force, but all
were expected to lend, and if any refused, they
were to be required to make oath that they
would not tell any body else that they had refused,
in order that the influence of their example
might not operate upon others. Those
who did refuse were to be reported to the government.
The officers appointed to collect
these loans were charged not to make unnecessary
difficulty, but to do all in their power to
induce the people to contribute freely and willingly.
This plan had been before adopted, in
the time of Buckingham, but it met with little
success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monopolies of the necessaries of life.</div>

<p>Another plan which was resorted to was the
granting of what was called monopolies: that
is, the government would select some important
and necessary articles in general use, and
give the exclusive right of manufacturing them
to certain persons, on their paying a part of the
profits to the government. Soap was one of
the articles thus chosen. The exclusive right
to manufacture it was given to a company, on
their paying for it. So with leather, salt, and
various other things. These persons, when
they once possessed the exclusive right to manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
an article which the people must use,
would abuse their power by deteriorating the
article, or charging enormous prices. Nothing
prevented their doing this, as they had no competition.
The effect was, that the people were
injured much more than the government was
benefited. The plan of granting such monopolies
by governments is now universally odious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tonnage and poundage.</div>

<p>Another method of taxation was what was
called <em>tonnage and poundage</em>. This was an
ancient tax, assessed on merchandise brought
into the country in ships, like the <em>duties</em> now
collected at our custom-houses. It was called
tonnage and poundage because the merchandise
on which it was assessed was reckoned by
weight, viz., the ton and the pound. A former
king, Edward <abbr title="3rd">III</abbr>., first assessed it to raise
money to suppress piracy on the seas. He said
it was reasonable that the merchandise protected
should pay the expense of the protection,
and in proper proportion. The Parliament in
that day opposed this tax. They did not object
to the tax itself, but to the king's assessing
it by his own authority. However, they granted
it themselves afterward, and it was regularly
collected. Subsequent Parliaments had
granted it, and generally made the law, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
for all, to continue in force during the life of
the monarch. When Charles commenced his
reign, the Peers were for renewing the law as
usual, to continue throughout his reign. The
Commons wanted to enact the law only for a
year at a time, so as to keep the power in their
own hands. The two houses thus disagreed,
and nothing was done. The king then went
on to collect the tax without any authority except
his own prerogative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ship money.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of these taxes.</div>

<p>Another mode of levying money adopted by
the king was what was called <em>ship money</em>.
This was a plan for raising a navy by making
every town contribute a certain number of
ships, or the money necessary to build them.
It originated in ancient times, and was at first
confined to seaport towns which had ships.
These towns were required to furnish them for
the king's service, sometimes to be paid for by
the king, at other times by the country, and at
other times not to be paid for at all. Charles
revived this plan, extending it to the whole
country; a tax was assessed on all the towns,
each one being required to furnish money
enough for a certain number of ships. The
number at one time required of the city of London
was twenty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1636.</div>

<div class="sidenote">John Hampden.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He refuses to pay ship money.</div>

<p>There was one man who made his name
very celebrated then, and it has continued very
celebrated since, by his refusal to pay his ship
money, and by his long and determined contest
with the government in regard to it, in the
courts. His name was John Hampden. He
was a man of fortune and high character. His
tax for ship money was only twenty shillings,
but he declared that he would not pay it without
a trial. The king had previously obtained
the opinion of the judges that he had a right, in
case of necessity, to assess and collect the ship
money, and Hampden knew, therefore, that the
decision would certainly, in the end, be against
him. He knew, however, that the attention of
the whole country would be attracted to the
trial, and that the arguments which he should
offer to prove that the act of collecting such a
tax on the part of the king's government was
illegal and tyrannical, would be spread before
the country, and would make a great impression,
although they certainly would not alter
the opinion of the judges, who, holding their
offices by the king's appointment, were strongly
inclined to take his side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hampden's trial.</div>

<p>It resulted as Hampden had foreseen. The
trial attracted universal attention. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
great spectacle to see a man of fortune and
standing like him, making all those preparations,
and incurring so great expense, on account
of a refusal to pay five dollars, knowing,
too, that he would have to pay it in the end.
The people of the realm were convinced that
Hampden was right, and they applauded and
honored him very greatly for his spirit and
courage. The trial lasted twelve days. The
illegality and injustice of the tax were fully exposed.
The people concurred entirely with
him, and even a part of the judges were convinced.
He was called the patriot Hampden,
and his name will always be celebrated in English
history. The whole discussion, however,
though it produced a great effect at the time,
would be of no interest now, since it turned
mainly on the question what the king's rights
actually were, according to the ancient customs
and usages of the realm. The question
before mankind now is a very different one;
it is not what the powers and prerogatives of
government have been in times past, but what
they ought to be now and in time to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1638.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He is compelled to pay.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A fleet raised.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its exploits among the herring-busses.</div>

<p>The king's government gained the victory,
ostensibly, in this contest, and Hampden had
to pay his money. Very large sums were collected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
also, from others by this tax, and a great
fleet was raised. The performances and exploits
of the fleet had some influence in quieting
the murmurs of the people. The fleet was
the greatest which England had ever possessed.
One of its exploits was to compel the Dutch to
pay a large sum for the privilege of fishing in
the narrow seas about Great Britain. The
Dutch had always maintained that these seas
were public, and open to all the world; and
they had a vast number of fishing boats, called
herring-busses, that used to resort to them for
the purpose of catching herring, which they
made a business of preserving and sending all
over the world. The English ships attacked
these fleets of herring-busses, and drove them
off; and as the Dutch were not strong enough
to defend them, they agreed to pay a large sum
annually, for the right to fish in the seas in
question, protesting, however, against it as an
extortion, for they maintained that the English
had no control over any seas beyond the
bays and estuaries of their own shores.</p>

<p>One of the chief means which Charles depended
upon during the long period that he
governed without a Parliament, was a certain
famous tribunal or court called the <em>Star Chamber</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>.
This court was a very ancient one, having
been established in some of the earliest
reigns; but it never attracted any special attention
until the time of Charles. His government
called it into action a great deal, and extended
its powers, and made it a means of great
injustice and oppression, as the people thought,
or, as Charles would have said, a very efficient
means of vindicating his prerogative, and punishing
the stubborn and rebellious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Court of the Star Chamber.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its constitution.</div>

<p>There were three reasons why this court was
a more convenient and powerful instrument in
the hands of the king and his council than any
of the other courts in the kingdom. First, it
was, by its ancient constitution, composed of
members of the <em>council</em>, with the exception of
two persons, who were to be judges in the other
courts. This plan of having two judges from
the common law courts seems to have been
adopted for the purpose of securing some sort
of conformity of the Star Chamber decisions
with the ordinary principles of English jurisprudence.
But then, as these two law judges
would always be selected with reference to
their disposition to carry out the king's plans,
and as the other members of the court were all
members of the government itself, of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
court was almost entirely under governmental
control.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trial by jury.</div>

<div class="sidenote">No jury in the Star Chamber.</div>

<p>The second reason was, that in this court
there was no jury. There had never been juries
employed in it from its earliest constitution.
The English had contrived the plan of
trial by jury as a defense against the severity
of government. If a man was accused of
crime, the judges appointed by the government
that he had offended were not to be allowed to
decide whether he was guilty or not. They
would be likely not to be impartial. The question
of his guilt or innocence was to be left to
twelve men, taken at hazard from the ordinary
walks of life, and who, consequently, would be
likely to sympathize with the accused, if they
saw any disposition to oppress him, rather than
to join against him with a tyrannical government.
Thus the jury, as they said, was a
great safeguard. The English have always attached
great value to their system of trial by
jury. The plan is retained in this country,
though there is less necessity for it under our
institutions. Now, in the Star Chamber, it
had never been the custom to employ a jury.
The members of the court decided the whole
question; and as they were entirely in the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the government, the government, of
course, had the fate of every person accused
under their direct control.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crimes tried by the Star Chamber.</div>

<p>The third reason consisted in the nature of
the crimes which it had always been customary
to try in this court. It had jurisdiction in
a great variety of cases in which men were
brought into collision with the government,
such as charges of riot, sedition, libel, opposition
to the edicts of the council, and to proclamations
of the king. These and similar cases
had always been tried by the Star Chamber;
and these were exactly the cases which ought
not to be tried by such a court; for persons accused
of hostility to government ought not to
be tried by government itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the term.</div>

<p>There has been a great deal of discussion
about the origin of the term Star Chamber.
The hall where the court was held was in a
palace at Westminster, and there were a great
many windows in it. Some think that it was
from this that the court received its name.
Others suppose it was because the court had
cognizance of a certain crime, the Latin name
of which has a close affinity with the word star.
Another reason is, that certain documents, called
<em>starra</em>, used to be kept in the hall. The prettiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
idea is a sort of tradition that the ceiling
of the hall was formerly ornamented with stars,
and that this circumstance gave name to the
hall. This supposition, however, unfortunately,
has no better foundation than the others; for
there were no stars on the ceiling in Charles's
time, and there had not been any for a hundred
years; nor is there any positive evidence that
there ever were. However, in the absence of
any real reason for preferring one of these ideas
over the other, mankind seem to have wisely
determined on choosing the prettiest of them,
so that it is generally agreed that the origin of
the name was the ancient decoration of the
ceiling of the hall with gilded stars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Immense power of the Court of Star Chamber.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Oppressive fines.</div>

<p>However this may be, the court of the Star
Chamber was an engine of prodigious power in
the hands of Charles's government. It helped
them in two ways. They could punish their
enemies, and where these enemies were wealthy,
they could fill up the treasury of the government
by imposing enormous fines upon them.
Sometimes the offenses for which these fines
were imposed were not of a nature to deserve
such severe penalties. For instance, there was
a law against turning tillage land into pasturage.
Land that is tilled supports men. Land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that is pastured supports cattle and sheep.
The former were a burden, sometimes, to landlords,
the latter a means of wealth. Hence
there was then, as there is now, a tendency in
England, in certain parts of the country, for
the landed proprietors to change their tillage
land to pasture, and thus drive the peasants
away from their homes. There were laws
against this, but a great many persons had
done it notwithstanding. One of these persons
was fined four thousand pounds; an enormous
sum. The rest were alarmed, and made <em>compositions</em>,
as they were called; that is, they
paid at once a certain sum on condition of not
being prosecuted. Thirty thousand pounds
were collected in this way, which was then a
very large amount.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King's forests.</div>

<p>There were in those days, as there are now,
certain tracts of land in England called the
king's forests, though a large portion of them
are now without trees. The boundaries of
these lands had not been very well defined, but
the government now published decrees specifying
the boundaries, and extending them so far
as to include, in many cases, the buildings and
improvements of other proprietors. They then
prosecuted these proprietors for having encroached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as they called it, upon the crown
lands, and the Star Chamber assessed very
heavy fines upon them. The people said all
this was done merely to get pretexts to extort
money from the nation, to make up for the
want of a Parliament to assess regular taxes;
but the government said it was a just and legal
mode of protecting the ancient and legitimate
rights of the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Offences against the king and his lords.</div>

<p>In these and similar modes, large sums of
money were collected as fines and penalties for
offenses more or less real. In other cases very
severe punishments were inflicted for various
sorts of offenses committed against the personal
dignity of the king, or the great lords of his
government. It was considered highly important
to repress all appearance of disrespect or
hostility to the king. One man got into some
contention with one of the king's officers, and
finally struck him. He was fined ten thousand
pounds. Another man said that a certain archbishop
had incurred the king's displeasure by
wanting some toleration for the Catholics.
This was considered a slander against the archbishop,
and the offender was sentenced to be
fined a thousand pounds, to be whipped, imprisoned,
and to stand in the pillory at Westminster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and at three other places in various
parts of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A gentleman fined for resenting an insult.</div>

<p>A gentleman was following a chase as a
spectator, the hounds belonging to a nobleman.
The huntsman, who had charge of the
hounds, ordered him to keep back, and not
come so near the hounds; and in giving him
this order, spoke, as the gentleman alleged, so
insolently, that he struck him with his riding-whip.
The huntsman threatened to complain
to his master, the nobleman. The gentleman
said that if his master should justify him in
such insulting language as he had used, he
would serve him in the same manner. The
Star Chamber fined him ten thousand pounds
for speaking so disrespectfully of a lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Murmurs silenced.</div>

<p>By these and similar proceedings, large sums
of money were collected by the Star Chamber
for the king's treasury, and all expression of
discontent and dissatisfaction on the part of the
people was suppressed. This last policy, however,
the suppression of expressions of dissatisfaction,
is always a very dangerous one for any
government to undertake. Discontent, silenced
by force, is exasperated and extended. The
outward signs of its existence disappear, but its
inward workings become wide-spread and dangerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
just in proportion to the weight by
which the safety-valve is kept down. Charles
and his court of the Star Chamber rejoiced in
the power and efficacy of their tremendous tribunal.
They issued proclamations and decrees,
and governed the country by means of
them. They silenced all murmurs. But they
were, all the time, disseminating through the
whole length and breadth of the land a deep
and inveterate enmity to royalty, which ended
in a revolution of the government, and the decapitation
of the king. They stopped the hissing
of the steam for the time, but caused an explosion
in the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1633.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The kingdom of Scotland.</div>

<p>Charles was King of Scotland as well as of
England. The two countries were, however,
as countries, distinct, each having its own laws,
its own administration, and its own separate
dominions. The sovereign, however, was the
same. A king could inherit two kingdoms,
just as a man can, in this country, inherit two
farms, which may, nevertheless, be at a distance
from each other, and managed separately.
Now, although Charles had, from the death of
his father, exercised sovereignty over the realm
of Scotland, he had not been crowned, nor had
even visited Scotland. The people of Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
felt somewhat neglected. They murmured
that their common monarch gave all his attention
to the sister and rival kingdom. They
said that if the king did not consider the Scottish
crown worth coming after, they might,
perhaps, look out for some other way of disposing
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king visits Scotland.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He is crowned there.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king returns to London.</div>

<p>The king, accordingly, in 1633, began to
make preparations for a royal progress into
Scotland. He first issued a proclamation requiring
a proper supply of provisions to be collected
at the several points of his proposed route,
and specified the route, and the length of stay
which he should make in each place. He set
out on the 13th of May with a splendid retinue.
He stopped at the seats of several of the
nobility on the way, to enjoy the hospitalities
and entertainments which they had prepared
for him. He proceeded so slowly that it was a
month before he reached the frontier. Here
all his English servants and retinue retired from
their posts, and their places were supplied by
Scotchmen who had been previously appointed,
and who were awaiting his arrival. He entered
Edinburgh with great pomp and parade, all
Scotland flocking, to the capital to witness the
festivities. The coronation took place three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
days afterward. He met the Scotch Parliament,
and, for form's sake, took a part in the
proceedings, so as actually to exercise his royal
authority as King of Scotland. This being
over, he was conducted in great state back to
Berwick, which is on the frontier, and thence
he returned by rapid journeys to London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing discontent.</div>

<p>The king dissolved his last Parliament in
1629. He had now been endeavoring for four
or five years to govern alone. He succeeded
tolerably well, so far as external appearances
indicated, up to this time. There was, however,
beneath the surface, a deep-seated discontent,
which was constantly widening and extending,
and, soon after the return of the king
from Scotland, real difficulties gradually arose,
by which he was, in the end, compelled to call
a Parliament again. What these difficulties
were will be explained in the subsequent chapters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Archbishop Laud.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">I</span>N getting so deeply involved in difficulties
with his people, King Charles did not act
alone. He had, as we have already explained,
a great deal of help. There were many men
of intelligence and rank who entertained the
same opinions that he did, or who were, at
least, willing to adopt them for the sake of
office and power. These men he drew around
him. He gave them office and power, and they
joined him in the efforts he made to defend and
enlarge the royal prerogative, and to carry on
the government by the exercise of it. One of
the most prominent and distinguished of these
men was Laud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Church.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1633-6.</div>

<div class="sidenote">System of the English Church.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Archbishop of Canterbury.</div>

<p>The reader must understand that <em>the Church</em>,
in England, is very different from any thing
that exists under the same name in this country.
Its bishops and clergy are supported by
revenues derived from a vast amount of property
which belongs to the Church itself. This
property is entirely independent of all control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
by the people of the parishes. The clergyman,
as soon as he is appointed, comes into possession
of it in his own right; and he is not appointed
by the people, but by some nobleman
or high officer of state, who has <em>inherited</em> the
right to appoint the clergyman, of that particular
parish. There are bishops, also, who have
very large revenues, likewise independent; and
over these bishops is one great dignitary, who
presides in lofty state over the whole system.
This officer is called the Archbishop of Canterbury.
There is one other archbishop, called the
Archbishop of York; but his realm is much
more limited and less important. The Archbishop
of Canterbury is styled the Lord Primate
of all England. His rank is above that
of all the peers of the realm. He crowns the
kings. He has two magnificent palaces, one at
Canterbury and one at London, for his residences,
and has very large revenues to maintain
a style of living in accordance with his
rank. He has the superintendence of all the
affairs of the Church for the whole realm, except
a small portion pertaining to the archbishopric
of York. His palace in London is on the
bank of the Thames, opposite Westminster.
It is called Lambeth Palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Canterbury.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Cathedral.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Officers.</div>

<p>The city of Canterbury, which is the chief
seat of his dominion, is southeast of London,
not very far from the sea. The Cathedral is
there, which is the archbishop's church. It is
more than five hundred feet in length, and the
tower is nearly two hundred and fifty feet high.
The magnificence of the architecture and the
decorations of the building correspond with its
size. There is a large company of clergymen
and other officers attached to the service of the
Cathedral. They are more than a hundred
in number. The palace of the archbishop is
near.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laud made archbishop.</div>

<p>The Church was thus, in the days of Charles,
a complete realm of itself, with its own property,
its own laws, its own legislature, and
courts, and judges, its own capital, and its own
monarch. It was entirely independent of the
mass of the people in all these respects, as all
these things were entirely controlled by the
bishops and clergy, and the clergy were generally
appointed by the noblemen, and the bishops
by the king. This made the system almost
entirely independent of the community at large;
and as there was organized under it a vast
amount of wealth, and influence, and power,
the Archbishop of Canterbury, who presided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
over the whole, was as great in authority as he
was in rank and honor. Now Laud was Archbishop
of Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His business capacity.</div>

<p>King Charles had made him so. He had observed
that Laud, who had been advanced to
some high stations in the Church by his father,
King James, was desirous to enlarge and
strengthen the powers and prerogatives of the
Church, just as he himself was endeavoring to
do in respect to those of the throne. He accordingly
promoted him from one post of influence
and honor to another, until he made him
at last Archbishop of Canterbury. Thus he
was placed upon the summit of ecclesiastical
grandeur and power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laud's character.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Episcopacy in England and the United States.</div>

<p>He commenced his work, however, of strengthening
and aggrandizing the Church, before he
was appointed to this high office. He was
Bishop of London for many years, which is a
post, in some respects, second only to that of
Archbishop of Canterbury. While in this station,
he was appointed by the king to many
high civil offices. He had great capacity for
the transaction of business, and for the fulfillment
of high trusts, whether of Church or state.
He was a man of great integrity and moral
worth. He was stern and severe in manners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but learned and accomplished. His whole soul
was bent on what he undoubtedly considered
the great duty of his life, supporting and confirming
the authority of the king, and the power
and influence of English Episcopacy. Notwithstanding
his high qualifications, however,
many persons were jealous of the influence
which he possessed with the king, and murmured
against the appointment of a churchman to
such high offices of state.</p>

<p>There was another source of hostility to
Laud. There was a large part of the people
of England who were against the Church of
England altogether. They did not like a system
in which all power and influence came,
as it were, from above downward. The king
made the noblemen, the noblemen made the
bishops, the bishops made the clergy, and the
clergy ruled their flocks; the flocks themselves
having nothing to say or do but to submit. It
is very different with Episcopacy in this country.
The people here choose the clergy, and
the clergy choose the bishops, so that power in
the Church, as in every thing else here, goes
from below upward. The two systems, when
at rest, look very similar in the two countries;
but when in action, the current of life flows in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
contrary directions, making the two diametrically
opposite to each other in spirit and power.
In England, Episcopacy is an engine by which
the people are ecclesiastically governed. Here,
it is the machinery by which they govern.
Whatever the forms are, the fact must be that
the people govern here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition to the Established Church.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Puritans.</div>

<p>Now in England there was a large and increasing
party who hated and opposed the
whole Episcopal system. Laud, to counteract
this tendency, attempted to define, and enlarge,
and extend that system as far as possible. He
made the most of all the ceremonies of worship,
and introduced others, which were, indeed, not
exactly new, but rather ancient ones revived.
He did this conscientiously, no doubt, thinking
that these forms of devotion were adapted to
impress the soul of the worshiper, and lead him
to feel, in his heart, the reverence which his
outward action expressed. Many of the people,
however, bitterly opposed these things. They
considered it a return to popery. The more
that Laud, and those who acted with him, attempted
to magnify the rites and the powers of
the Church, the more these persons began to
abhor every thing of the kind. They wanted
Christianity itself, <em>in its purity</em>, uncontaminated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
as they said, by these popish and idolatrous
forms. They were called <em>Puritans</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disputes about the services of the Church.</div>

<p>There were a great many things which seem
to us at the present day of very little consequence,
which were then the subjects of endless
disputes and of the most bitter animosity.
For instance, one point was whether the place
where the communion was to be administered
should be called the communion table or the
altar; and in what part of the church it should
stand; and whether the person officiating
should be called a priest or a clergyman; and
whether he should wear one kind of dress or
another. Great importance was attached to
these things; but it was not on their own account,
but on account of their bearing on the
question whether the Lord's Supper was to be
considered only a ceremony commemorative of
Christ's death, or whether it was, whenever
celebrated by a regularly authorized priest, <em>a
real renewal</em> of the sacrifice of Christ, as the
Catholics maintained. Calling the communion
table an altar, and the officiating minister a
priest, and clothing him in a sacerdotal garb,
countenanced the idea of a renewal of the sacrifice
of Christ. Laud and his coadjutors urged
the adoption of all these and similar usages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
The Puritans detested them, because they detested
and abhorred the doctrine which they
seemed to imply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Controversy about amusements on Sunday.</div>

<p>Another great topic of controversy was the
subject of amusements. It is a very singular
circumstance, that in those branches of the
Christian Church where rites and forms are
most insisted upon, the greatest latitude is allowed
in respect to the gayeties and amusements
of social life. Catholic Paris is filled with theaters
and dancing, and the Sabbath is a holiday.
In London, on the other hand, the number
of theaters is small, dancing is considered
as an amusement of a more or less equivocal
character, and the Sabbath is rigidly observed;
and among all the simple Democratic churches
of New England, to dance or to attend the theater
is considered almost morally wrong. It
was just so in the days of Laud. He wished
to encourage amusements among the people,
particularly on Sunday, after church. This
was partly for the purpose of counteracting the
efforts of those who were inclined to Puritan
views. They attached great importance to
their sermons and lectures, for in them they
could address and influence the people. But
by means of these addresses, as Laud thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
they put ideas of insubordination into the minds
of the people, and encroached on the authority
of the Church and of the king. To prevent
this, the High-Church party wished to exalt the
<em>prayers</em> in the Church service, and to give as
little place and influence as possible to the sermon,
and to draw off the attention of the people
from the discussions and exhortations of the
preachers by encouraging games, dances, and
amusements of all kinds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laud's contention with the judges.</div>

<p>The judges in one of the counties, at a regular
court held by them, once passed an order
forbidding certain revels and carousals connected
with the Church service, on account of the
immoralities and disorders, as they alleged, to
which they gave rise; and they ordered that
public notice to this effect should be given by
the bishop. The archbishop (Laud) considered
this an interference on the part of the civil
magistrates with the powers and prerogatives
of the Church. He had the judges brought before
the council, and censured there; and they
were required by the council to revoke their
order at the next court. The judges did so, but
in such a way as to show that they did it simply
in obedience to the command of the king's
council. The people, or at least all of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
who were inclined to Puritan views, sided with
the judges, and were more strict in abstaining
from all such amusements on Sunday than
ever. This, of course, made those who were
on the side of Laud more determined to promote
these gayeties. Thus, as neither party
pursued, in the least degree, a generous or conciliatory
course toward the other, the difference
between them widened more and more. The
people of the country were fast becoming either
bigoted High-Churchmen or fanatical Puritans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Severe punishments for expression of opinion.</div>

<p>Laud employed the power of the Star Chamber
a great deal in the accomplishment of his
purpose of enforcing entire submission to the
ecclesiastical authority of the Church. He
even had persons sometimes punished very severely
for words of disrespect, or for writings in
which they censured what they considered the
tyranny under which they suffered. This severe
punishment for the mere expression of
opinion only served to fix the opinion more
firmly, and disseminate it more widely. Sometimes
men would glory in their sufferings for
this cause, and bid the authorities defiance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Case of Lilburne.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His indomitable spirit.</div>

<p>One man, for instance, named Lilburne, was
brought before the Star Chamber, charged with
publishing seditious pamphlets. Now, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ordinary courts of justice, no man is called
upon to say any thing against himself. Unless
his crime can be proved by the testimony of
others, it can not be proved at all. But in the
Star Chamber, whoever was brought to trial
had to take an oath at first that he would answer
all questions asked, even if they tended to
criminate himself. When they proposed this
oath to Lilburne, he refused to take it. They
decided that this was contempt of court, and
sentenced him to be whipped, put in the pillory,
and imprisoned. While they were whipping
him, he spent the time in making a speech to
the spectators against the tyranny of bishops,
referring to Laud, whom he considered as the
author of these proceedings. He continued to
do the same while in the pillory. As he passed
along, too, he distributed copies of the pamphlets
which he was prosecuted for writing. The
Star Chamber, hearing that he was haranguing
the mob, ordered him to be gagged. This
did not subdue him. He began to stamp with
his foot and gesticulate; thus continuing to express
his indomitable spirit of hostility to the
tyranny which he opposed. This single case
would be of no great consequence alone, but it
was not alone. The attempt to put Lilburne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
down was a symbol of the experiment of coercion
which Charles in the state, and Laud in
the Church, were trying upon the whole nation;
it was a symbol both in respect to the
means employed, and to the success attained
by them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The young lawyers' toast.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ingenious plea.</div>

<p>One curious case is related, which turned out
more fortunately than usual for the parties accused.
Some young lawyers in London were
drinking at an evening entertainment, and
among other toasts they drank confusion to the
Archbishop of Canterbury. One of the waiters,
who heard them, mentioned the circumstance,
and they were brought before the Star
Chamber. Before their trial came on, they applied
to a certain nobleman to know what they
should do. "Where was the waiter," asked
the nobleman, "when you drank the toast?"
"At the door." "Oh! very well, then," said
he; "tell the court that he only heard a part
of the toast, as he was going out; and that the
words really were, 'Confusion to the Archbishop
of Canterbury's enemies.'" By this ingenious
plea, and by means of a great appearance of
humility and deference in the presence of the
archbishop, the lawyers escaped with a reprimand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Laud's designs upon the Scotch Church.</div>

<p>Laud was not content with establishing and
confirming throughout all England the authority
of the Church, but he wanted to extend the
same system to Scotland. When King Charles
went to Scotland to be crowned, he took Laud
with him. He was pleased with Laud's endeavors
to enlarge and confirm the powers of
the Church, and wished to aid him in the work.
There were two reasons for this. One was, that
the same class of men, the Puritans, were the
natural enemies of both, so that the king and
the archbishop were drawn together by having
one common foe. Then, as the places in the
Church were not hereditary, but were filled by
appointments from the king and the great nobles,
whatever power the Church could get into
its hands could be employed by the king to
strengthen his own authority, and keep his subjects
in subjection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motives of Laud and the king.</div>

<p>We must not, however, censure the king and
his advisers too strongly for this plan. They
doubtless were ambitious; they loved power;
they wanted to bear sway, unresisted and unquestioned,
over the whole realm. But then
the king probably thought that the exercise of
such a government was necessary for the order
and prosperity of the realm, besides being his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
inherent and indefeasible right. Good and bad
motives were doubtless mingled here, as in all
human action; but then the king was, in the
main, doing what he supposed it was his duty
to do. In proposing, therefore, to build up the
Church in Scotland, and to make it conform to
the English Church in its rites and ceremonies,
he and Laud doubtless supposed that they were
going greatly to improve the government of the
sister kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Liturgy.</div>

<p>There was in those days, as now, in the English
Church, a certain prescribed course of
prayers, and psalms, and Scripture readings,
for each day, to be read from a book by the
minister. This was called the Liturgy. The
Puritans did not like a liturgy. It tied men
up, and did not leave the individual mind of the
preacher at liberty to range freely, as they
wished it to do, in conducting the devotional
services. It was on this very account that the
friends of strong government <em>did</em> like it. They
wanted to curtail this liberty, which, however,
they called license, and which they thought
made mischief. In extemporaneous prayers, it
is often easy to see that the speaker is aiming
much more directly at producing a salutary effect
on the minds of his hearers than at simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
presenting petitions to the Supreme Being.
But, notwithstanding this evil, the existence of
which no candid man can deny, the enemies of
forms, who are generally friends of the largest
liberty, think it best to leave the clergyman
free. The friends of forms, however, prefer
forms on this very account. They like what
they consider the wholesome and salutary restraints
which they impose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scotch.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Laud prepares them a Liturgy.</div>

<p>Now there has always been a great spirit of
freedom in the Scottish mind. That people have
ever been unwilling to submit to coercion or
restraints. There is probably no race of men
on earth that would make worse slaves than the
Scotch. Their sturdy independence and determination
to be free could never be subdued. In
the days of Charles they were particularly fond
of freely exercising their own minds, and of
speaking freely to others on the subject of religion.
They thought for themselves, sometimes
right and sometimes wrong; but they would
think, and they would express their thoughts;
and their being thus unaccustomed, in one particular,
to submit to restraints, rendered them
more difficult to be governed in others. Laud
thought, consequently, that <em>they</em>, particularly,
needed a Liturgy. He prepared one for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
It was varied somewhat from the English Liturgy,
though it was substantially the same.
The king proclaimed it, and required the bishops
to see that it was employed in all the
churches in Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1637.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Scenes of tumult.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Preaching to an empty church.</div>

<p>The day for introducing the Liturgy was the
signal for riots all over the kingdom. In the
principal church in Edinburgh they called out
"<em>A pope! A pope!</em>" when the clergyman came
in with his book and his pontifical robes. The
bishop ascended the pulpit to address the people
to appease them, and a stool came flying
through the air at his head. The police then
expelled the congregation, and the clergyman
went through with the service of the Liturgy
in the empty church, the congregation outside,
in great tumult, accompanying the exercises
with cries of disapprobation and resentment,
and with volleys of stones against the doors and
windows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scotch rebel.</div>

<p>The Scotch sent a sort of embassador to London
to represent to the king that the hostility
to the Liturgy was so universal and so strong
that it could not be enforced. But the king
and his council had the same conscientious
scruples about giving up in a contest with subjects,
that a teacher or a parent, in our day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
would feel in the case of resistance from children
or scholars. The king sent down a proclamation
that the observance of the Liturgy
must be insisted on. The Scotch prepared to
resist. They sent delegates to Edinburgh, and
organized a sort of government. They raised
armies. They took possession of the king's
castles. They made a solemn covenant, binding
themselves to insist on religious freedom.
In a word, all Scotland was in rebellion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's fool.</div>

<p>It was the custom in those days to have, connected
with the court, some half-witted person,
who used to be fantastically dressed, and to have
great liberty of speech, and whose province was
to amuse the courtiers. He was called the <em>king's
jester</em>, or, more commonly, <em>the fool</em>. The name
of King Charles's fool was Archy. After this
rebellion broke out, and all England was aghast
at the extent of the mischief which Laud's Liturgy
had done, the fool, seeing the archbishop go
by one day, called out to him, "My lord! who
is the fool now?" The archbishop, as if to
leave no possible doubt in respect to the proper
answer to the question, had poor Archy tried
and punished. His sentence was to have his
coat pulled up over his head, and to be dismissed
from the king's service. Had the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
let it pass, it would have ended with a
laugh in the street; but by resenting it, he
gave it notoriety, caused it to be recorded, and
has perpetuated the memory of the jest to all
future times. He ought to have joined in the
laugh, and rewarded Archy on the spot for so
good a witticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A general assembly called in Scotland.</div>

<p>The Scotch, besides organizing a sort of civil
government, took measures for summoning a
general assembly of their Church. This assembly
met at Glasgow. The nobility and
gentry flocked to Glasgow at the time of the
meeting, to encourage and sustain the assembly,
and to manifest their interest in the proceedings.
The assembly very deliberately went
to work, and, not content with taking a stand
against the Liturgy which Charles had imposed,
they abolished the fabric of Episcopacy&mdash;that
is, the government of bishops&mdash;altogether.
Thus Laud's attempt to perfect and confirm
the system resulted in expelling it completely
from the kingdom. It has never held up its
head in Scotland since. They established
Presbyterianism in its place, which is a sort of
republican system, the pastors being all officially
equal to each other, though banded together
under a common government administered
by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1639.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's expedition to the north.</div>

<p>The king was determined to put down this
rebellion at all hazards. He had made such
good use of the various irregular modes of raising
money which have been already described,
and had been so economical in the use of it,
that he had now quite a sum of money in his
treasury; and had it not been for the attempt
to enforce the unfortunate Liturgy upon the
people of Scotland, he might, perhaps, have
gone on reigning without a Parliament to the
end of his days. He had now about two hundred
thousand pounds, by means of which, together
with what he could borrow, he hoped to
make one single demonstration of force which
would bring the rebellion to an end. He raised
an army and equipped a fleet. He issued a
proclamation summoning all the peers of the
realm to attend him. He moved with this great
concourse from London toward the north, the
whole country looking on as spectators to behold
the progress of this great expedition, by
which their monarch was going to attempt to
subdue again his <em>other</em> kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The army at York.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The oath.</div>

<p>Charles advanced to the city of York, the
great city of the north of England. Here he
paused and established his court, with all possible
pomp and parade. His design was to impress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the Scots with such an idea of the greatness
of the power which was going to overwhelm
them as to cause them to submit at
once. But all this show was very hollow and
delusive. The army felt a greater sympathy
with the Scots than they did with the king.
The complaints against Charles's government
were pretty much the same in both countries.
A great many Scotchmen came to York while
the king was there, and the people from all the
country round flocked thither too, drawn by the
gay spectacles connected with the presence of
such a court and army. The Scotchmen disseminated
their complaints thus among the
English people, and finally the king and his
council, finding indications of so extensive a
disaffection, had a form of an oath prepared,
which they required all the principal persons to
take, acknowledging allegiance to Charles, and
renouncing their having any intelligence or correspondence
with the enemy. The Scotchmen
all took the oath very readily, though some of
the English refused.</p>

<p>At any rate, the state of things was not such
as to intimidate the Scotch, and lead them, as
the king had hoped, to sue for peace. So he
concluded to move on toward the borders. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
went to Newcastle, and thence to Berwick.
From Berwick he moved along the banks of the
Tweed, which here forms the boundary between
the two kingdoms, and, finding a suitable place
for such a purpose, the king had his royal tent
pitched, and his army encamped around him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's march.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Artifice of the Scots.</div>

<p>Now, as King Charles had undertaken to subdue
the Scots by a show of force, it seems they
concluded to defend themselves by a show too,
though theirs was a cheaper and more simple
contrivance than his. They advanced with
about three thousand men to a place distant
perhaps seven miles from the English camp.
The king sent an army of five thousand men to
attack them. The Scotch, in the mean time,
collected great herds of cattle from all the country
around, as the historians say, and arranged
them behind their little army in such a way
as to make the whole appear a vast body of
soldiers. A troop of horsemen, who were the
advanced part of the English army, came in
sight of this formidable host first, and, finding
their numbers so much greater than they had
anticipated, they fell back, and ordered the artillery
and foot-soldiers who were coming up to
retreat, and all together came back to the encampment.
There were two or three military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
enterprises of similar character, in which nothing
was done but to encourage the Scotch and
dishearten the English. In fact, neither officers,
soldiers, nor king wanted to proceed to extremities.
The officers and soldiers did not
wish to fight the Scotch, and the king, knowing
the state of his army, did not really dare to
do it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The compromise.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The army disbanded.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's difficulties.</div>

<p>Finally, all the king's council advised him to
give up the pretended contest, and to settle the
difficulty by a compromise. Accordingly, in
June, negotiations were commenced, and before
the end of the month articles were signed.
The king probably made the best terms he
could, but it was universally considered that
the Scots gained the victory. The king disbanded
his army, and returned to London.
The Scotch leaders went back to Edinburgh.
Soon after this the Parliament and the General
Assembly of the Church convened, and these
bodies took the whole management of the realm
into their own hands. They sent commissioners
to London to see and confer with the king,
and these commissioners seemed almost to assume
the character of embassadors from a foreign
state. These negotiations, and the course
which affairs were taking in Scotland, soon led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to new difficulties. The king found that he
was losing his kingdom of Scotland altogether.
It seemed, however, as if there was nothing that
he could do to regain it. His reserved funds
were gone, and his credit was exhausted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He thinks of a Parliament.</div>

<p>There was no resource left but to call a Parliament
and ask for supplies. He might have
known, however, that this would be useless, for
there was so strong a fellow-feeling with the
Scotch in their alleged grievances among the
people of England, that he could not reasonably
expect any response from the latter, in whatever
way he might appeal to them.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> VII.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Earl of Strafford.</span></p>


<div class="sidenote">1621.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">D</span>URING the time that the king had been
engaged in the attempt to govern England
without Parliaments, he had, besides
Laud, a very efficient co-operator, known in
English history by the name of the Earl of
Strafford. This title of Earl of Strafford was
conferred upon him by the king as a reward for
his services. His father's name was Wentworth.
He was born in London, and the
Christian name given to him was Thomas.
He was educated at the University of Cambridge,
and was much distinguished for his talents
and his personal accomplishments. After
finishing his education, he traveled for some
time on the Continent, visiting foreign cities
and courts, and studying the languages, manners,
and customs of other nations. He returned
at length to England. He was made a
knight. His father died when he was about
twenty-one, and left him a large fortune. He
was about seven years older than King Charles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
so that all these circumstances took place before
the commencement of Charles's reign.
For many years after this he was very extensively
known in England as a gentleman of
large fortune and great abilities, by the name
of Sir Thomas Wentworth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earl of Strafford.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His early life.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Strafford's course in Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His opposition to the king.</div>

<p>Sir Thomas Wentworth was a member of
Parliament in those days, and in the contests
between the king and the Parliament he took
the side of Parliament. Charles used to maintain
that <em>his</em> power alone was hereditary and
sovereign; that the Parliament was his council;
and that they had no powers or privileges
except what he himself or his ancestors had
granted and allowed them. Wentworth took
very strong ground against this. He urged
Parliament to maintain that their rights and
privileges were inherent and hereditary as well
as those of the king; that such powers as they
possessed were their own, and were entirely independent
of royal grant or permission; and
that the king could no more encroach upon the
privileges of Parliament, than Parliament upon
the prerogatives of the king. This was in the
beginning of the difficulties between the king
and the Commons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1628.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The leaders removed.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The opposition still continues.</div>

<p>It will, perhaps, be recollected by the reader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that one of the plans which Charles adopted to
weaken the opposition to him in Parliament
was by appointing six of the leaders of this opposition
to the office of sheriff in their several
counties. And as the general theory of all
monarchies is that the subjects are bound to
obey and serve the king, these men were obliged
to leave their seats in Parliament and go
home, to serve as sheriffs. Charles and his
council supposed that the rest would be more
quiet and submissive when the leaders of the
party opposed to him were taken away. But
the effect was the reverse. The Commons
were incensed at such a mode of interfering
with their action, and became more hostile to
the royal power than ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wentworth imprisoned.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His return to Parliament.</div>

<p>Wentworth himself, too, was made more determined
in his opposition by this treatment.
A short time after this, the king's plan of a
forced loan was adopted, which has already
been described; that is, a sum of money was
assessed in the manner of a tax upon all the
people of the kingdom, and each man was required
to lend his proportion to the government.
The king admitted that he had no right to
make people <em>give</em> money without the action of
Parliament, but claimed the right to require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
them to <em>lend</em> it. As Sir Thomas Wentworth
was a man of large fortune, his share of the
loan was considerable. He absolutely refused
to pay it. The king had him brought before a
court which was entirely under his influence,
and he was condemned to be imprisoned.
Knowing, however, that this claim on the part
of the king was very doubtful, they mitigated
his confinement by allowing him first a range
of two miles around his place of confinement,
and afterward they released him entirely.</p>

<p>He was chosen a member of Parliament
again, and he returned to his seat more powerful
and influential than ever. Buckingham,
who had been his greatest enemy, was now
dead, and the king, finding that he had great
abilities and a spirit that would not yield to intimidation
or force, concluded to try kindness and favors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wentworth is courted.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He goes over to the king.</div>

<p>In fact, there are two different modes by
which sovereigns in all ages and countries endeavor
to neutralize the opposition of popular
leaders. One is by intimidating them with
threats and punishments, and the other buying
them off with appointments and honors. Some
of the king's high officers of state began to cultivate
the acquaintance of Wentworth, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
pay him attentions and civilities. He could
not but feel gratified with these indications of
their regard. They complimented his talents
and his powers, and represented to him that
such abilities ought to be employed in the service
of the state. Finally, the king conferred
upon him the title of baron. Common gratitude
for these marks of distinction and honor
held him back from any violent opposition to
the king. His enemies said he was bought off
by honors and rewards. No doubt he was ambitious,
and, like all other politicians, his supreme
motive was love of consideration and
honor. This was doubtless his motive in what
he had done in behalf of the Parliament. But
all that he could do as a popular leader in Parliament
was to acquire a general ascendency
over men's minds, and make himself a subject
of fame and honor. All places of real authority
were exclusively under the king's control,
and he could only rise to such stations through
the sovereign's favor. In a word, he could acquire
only <em>influence</em> as a leader in Parliament,
while the king could give him <em>power</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king appoints Wentworth to office.</div>

<p>Kings have always, accordingly, a great control
over the minds of legislators by offering
them office; and King Charles, after finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that his first advances to Wentworth were favorably
received, appointed him one of his Privy
Council. Wentworth accepted the office. His
former friends considered that in doing this he
was deserting them, and betraying the cause
which he had at first espoused and defended.
The country at large were much displeased
with him, finding that he had forsaken their
cause, and placed himself in a position to act
against them.</p>

<p>Persons who change sides in politics or in
religion are very apt to go from one extreme to
another. Their former friends revile them, and
they, in retaliation, act more and more energetically
against them. It was so with Strafford.
He gradually engaged more and more
fully and earnestly in upholding the king.
Finally, the king appointed him to a very high
station, called the Presidency of the North.
His office was to govern the whole north of England&mdash;of
course, under the direction of the
king and council. There were four counties
under his jurisdiction, and the king gave him
a commission which clothed him with enormous
powers&mdash;powers greater, as all the people
thought, than the king had any right to bestow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>


<div class="sidenote">Wentworth is appointed President of the North.</div>

<p>Strafford proceeded to the north, and entered
upon the government of his realm there, with
a determination to carry out all the king's
plans to the utmost. From being an ardent
advocate of the rights of the people, as he was
at the commencement of his career, he became
a most determined and uncompromising supporter
of the arbitrary power of the king. He
insisted on the collection of money from the
people in all the ways that the king claimed
the power to collect it by authority of his prerogative;
and he was so strict and exacting in
doing this, that he raised the revenue to four
or five times what any of his predecessors had
been able to collect. This, of course, pleased
King Charles and his government extremely;
for it was at a time during which the king was
attempting to govern without a Parliament,
and every accession to his funds was of extreme
importance. Laud, too, the archbishop,
was extremely pleased with his exertions and
his success, and the king looked upon Laud
and Wentworth as the two most efficient supporters
of his power. They were, in fact, the
two most efficient promoters of his destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1632.</div>

<p>Of course, the people of the north hated him.
While he was earning the applause of the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and the king, and entitling himself to
new honors and increased power, he was sowing
the seeds of the bitterest animosity in the
hearts of the people every where. Still he enjoyed
all the external marks of consideration
and honor. The President of the North was a
sort of king. He was clothed with great powers,
and lived in great state and splendor. He
had many attendants, and the great nobles of
the land, who generally took Charles's side in
the contests of the day, envied Wentworth's
greatness and power, and applauded the energy
and success of his administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wentworth appointed to the government of Ireland.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Wentworth's arbitrary government.</div>

<p>Ireland was, at this time, in a disturbed and
disordered state, and Laud proposed that Wentworth
should be appointed by the king to the
government of it. A great proportion of the
inhabitants were Catholics, and were very little
disposed to submit to Protestant rule. Wentworth
was appointed lord deputy, and afterward
lord lieutenant, which made him king
of Ireland in all but the name. Every thing,
of course, was done in the name of Charles.
He carried the same energy into his government
here that he had exhibited in the north
of England. He improved the condition of the
country astonishingly in respect to trade, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
revenue, and to public order. But he governed
in the most arbitrary manner, and he boasted
that he had rendered the king as absolute a
sovereign in Ireland as any prince in the world
could be. Such a boast from a man who had
once been a very prominent defender of the
rights of the people against this very kind of
sovereignty, was fitted to produce a feeling of
universal exasperation and desire of revenge.
The murmurs and muttered threats which
filled the land, though suppressed, were very
deep and very strong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is made an earl.</div>

<p>The king, however, and Laud, considered
Wentworth as their most able and efficient coadjutor;
and when the difficulties in Scotland
began to grow serious, they recalled him from
Ireland, and put that country into the hands of
another ruler. The king then advanced him
to the rank of an earl. His title was the Earl
of Strafford. As the subsequent parts of his
history attracted more attention than those
preceding his elevation to this earldom, he has
been far more widely known among mankind
by the name of Strafford than by his original
name of Wentworth, which was, from this period,
nearly forgotten.</p>

<p>To return now to the troubles in Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
The king found that it would be impossible to
go on without supplies, and he accordingly concluded,
on the whole, to call a Parliament.
He was in serious trouble. Laud was in serious
trouble too. He had been indefatigably
engaged for many years in establishing Episcopacy
all over England, and in putting down,
by force of law, all disposition to dissent from
it; and in attempting to produce, throughout
the realm, one uniform system of Christian
faith and worship. This was his idea of the
perfection of religious order and right. He
used to make an annual visitation to all the
bishoprics in the realm; inquire into the usages
which prevailed there; put a stop, so far as he
could, to all irregularities; and confirm and
establish, by the most decisive measures, the
Episcopal authority. He sent in his report to
the king of the results of his inquiries, asking
the king's aid, where his own powers were insufficient,
for the more full accomplishment of
his plans. But, notwithstanding all this diligence
and zeal, he found that he met with very
partial success. The irregularities, as he called
them, which he suppressed in one place,
would break out in another; the disposition to
throw off the dominion of bishops was getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
more and more extensive and deeply seated;
and now, the result of the religious revolution
in Scotland, and of the general excitement
which it produced in England, was to widen
and extend this feeling more than ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defense of Episcopacy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of non-conformity.</div>

<p>He did not, however, give up the contest.
He employed an able writer to draw up a defense
of Episcopacy, as the true and scriptural
form of Church government. The book, when
first prepared, was moderate in its tone, and allowed
that in some particular cases a Presbyterian
mode of government might be admissible;
but Laud, in revising the book, struck out
these concessions as unnecessary and dangerous,
and placed Episcopacy in full and exclusive
possession of the ground, as the divinely
instituted and only admissible form of Church
government and discipline. He caused this
book to be circulated; but the attempt to reason
with the refractory, after having failed in
the attempt to coerce them, is not generally
very successful. The archbishop, in his report
to the king this year of the state of things
throughout his province, represents the spirit
of non-conformity to the Church of England as
getting too strong for him to control without
more efficient help from the civil power; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
whether it would be wise, he added, to undertake
any more effectual coercion in the present
distracted state of the kingdom, he left it for
the king to decide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Parliament called.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Strafford appointed commander-in-chief.</div>

<p>Laud proposed that the council should recommend
to the king the calling of a Parliament.
At the same time, they passed a resolution
that, in case the Parliament "should prove
peevish, and refuse to grant supplies, they would
sustain the king in the resort to extraordinary
measures." This was regarded as a threat,
and did not help to prepossess the members favorably
in regard to the feeling with which the
king was to meet them. The king ordered the
Parliament to be elected in December, but did
not call them together until April. In the
mean time, he went on raising an army, so as
to have his military preparations in readiness.
He, however, appointed a new set of officers to
the command of this army, neglecting those
who were in command before, as he had found
them so little disposed to act efficiently in his
cause. He supplied the leader's place with
Strafford. This change produced very extensive
murmurs of dissatisfaction, which, added
to all the other causes of complaint, made the
times look very dark and stormy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting of Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's speech.</div>

<p>The Parliament assembled in April. The
king went into the House of Lords, the Commons
being, as usual, summoned to the bar.
He addressed them as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My Lords and gentlemen,&mdash;There was
never a King who had a more great and weighty
Cause to call his People together than myself.
I will not trouble you with the particulars.
I have informed my Lord keeper, and
now command him to speak, and I desire your
Attention."</p></div>

<p>The keeper referred to was the keeper of the
king's seals, who was, of course, a great officer
of state. He made a speech, informing the
houses, in general terms, of the king's need of
money, but said that it was not necessary for
him to explain minutely the monarch's plans,
as they were exclusively his own concern.
We may as well quote his words, in order to
show in what light the position and province of
a British Parliament was considered in those
days.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"His majesty's kingly resolutions," said the
lord keeper, "are seated in the ark of his sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>breast, and it were a presumption of too
high a nature for any Uzzah uncalled to touch
it. Yet his Majesty is now pleased to lay by
the shining Beams of Majesty, as Phœbus did
to Phaeton, that the distance between Sovereignty
and Subjection should not bar you of
that filial freedom of Access to his Person and
Counsels; only let us beware how, with the
Son of Clymene, we aim not at the guiding of
the Chariot, as if that were the only Testimony
of Fatherly Affection; and let us remember,
that though the King sometimes lays by the
Beams and Rays of Majesty, he never lays by
Majesty itself."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Address of the lord keeper.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Grievances.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Messages.</div>

<p>When the keeper had finished his speech, the
king confirmed it by saying that he had exaggerated
nothing, and the houses were left to
their deliberations. Instead of proceeding to
the business of raising money, they commenced
an inquiry into the grievances, as they called
them&mdash;that is, all the unjust acts and the maladministration
of the government, of which the
country had been complaining for the ten years
during which there had been an intermission
of Parliaments. The king did all in his power
to arrest this course of procedure. He sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
them message after message, urging them to
leave these things, and take up first the question
of supplies. He then sent a message to
the House of Peers, requesting them to interpose,
and exert their influence to lead the Commons
to act. The Peers did so. The Commons
sent them back a reply that their interference
in the business of supply, which belonged
to the Commons alone, was a breach of
their privileges. "And," they added, "therefore,
the Commons desire their lordships in their
wisdom to find out some way for the reparation
of their privileges broken by that act, and to
prevent the like infringement in future."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament dissolved.</div>

<p>Thus repulsed on every hand, the king gave
up the hope of accomplishing any thing through
the action of the House of Commons, and he
suddenly determined to dissolve Parliament.
The session had continued only about three
weeks. In dissolving the Parliament the king
took no notice of the Commons whatever, but
addressed the Lords alone. The Commons and
the whole country were incensed at such capricious
treatment of the national Legislature.</p>

<p>The king and his council tried all summer
to get the army ready to be put in motion.
The great difficulty, of course, was want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
funds. The <em>Convocation</em>, which was the great
council of the Church, and which was accustomed
in those days to sit simultaneously with
Parliament, continued their session afterward
in this case, and raised some money for the
king. The nobles of the court subscribed a
considerable amount, also, which they lent him.
They wanted to sustain him in his contest
with the Commons on their own account, and
then, besides, they felt a personal interest in
him, and a sympathy for him in the troubles
which were thickening around him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scots cross the borders and invade England.</div>

<p>The summer months passed away in making
the preparations and getting the various bodies
of troops ready, and the military stores collected
at the place of rendezvous in York and Newcastle.
The Scots, in the mean time, had been
assembling their forces near the borders, and,
being somewhat imboldened by their success in
the previous campaign, crossed the frontier, and
advanced boldly to meet the forces of the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March of the Scots.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king goes to York.</div>

<p>They published a manifesto, declaring that
they were not entering England with any hostile
intent toward their sovereign, but were
only coming to present to him their humble petitions
for a redress of their grievances, which
they said they were sure he would graciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
receive as soon as he had opportunity to learn
from them how great their grievances had been.
They respectfully requested that the people of
England would allow them to pass safely and
without molestation through the land, and
promised to conduct themselves with the utmost
propriety and decorum. This promise
they kept. They avoided molesting the inhabitants
in any way, and purchased fairly every
thing they consumed. When the English officers
learned that the Scotch had crossed the
Tweed, they sent on immediately to London,
to the king, urging him to come north at once,
and join the army, with all the remaining forces
at his command. The king did so, but it
was too late. He arrived at York; from York
he went northward to reach the van of his
army, which had been posted at Newcastle, but
on his way he was met by messengers saying
that they were in full retreat, and that the
Scotch had got possession of Newcastle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of the English.</div>

<p>The circumstances of the battle were these.
Newcastle is upon the Tyne. The banks at
Newcastle are steep and high, but about four
miles above the town is a place called Newburn,
where was a meadow near the river, and a convenient
place to cross. The Scotch advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in a very slow and orderly manner to Newburn,
and encamped there. The English sent a detachment
from Newcastle to arrest their progress.
The Scotch begged them not to interrupt
their march, as they were only going to
<em>present petitions to the king</em>! The English
general, of course, paid no attention to this pretext.
The Scotch army then attacked them,
and soon put them to flight. The routed English
soldiers fled to Newcastle, and were there
joined by all that portion of the army which
was in Newcastle in a rapid retreat. The
Scotch took possession of the town, but conducted
themselves in a very orderly manner,
and bought and paid for every thing they used.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perplexities and dangers.</div>

<p>The poor king was now in a situation of the
most imminent and terrible danger. Rebel
subjects had got full possession of one kingdom,
and were now advancing at the head of victorious
armies into the other. He himself had
entirely alienated the affections of a large portion
of his subjects, and had openly quarreled
with and dismissed the Legislature. He had
no funds, and had exhausted all possible means
of raising funds. He was half distracted with
the perplexities and dangers of his position.</p>

<p>His deciding on dissolving Parliament in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
spring was a hasty step, and he bitterly regretted
it the moment the deed was done. He
wanted to recall it. He deliberated several
days about the possibility of summoning the
same members to meet again, and constituting
them again a Parliament. But the lawyers
insisted that this could not be done. A dissolution
was a dissolution. The Parliament, once
dissolved, was no more. It could not be brought
to life again. There must be new orders to
the country to proceed to new elections. To
do this at once would have been too humiliating
for the king. He now found, however,
that the necessity for it could no longer be postponed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king calls a council of peers.</div>

<p>There was such a thing in the English
history as a council of peers alone, called
in a sudden emergency which did not allow of
time for the elections necessary to constitute
the House of Commons. Charles called such
a council of peers to meet at York, and they
immediately assembled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Message from the Scots.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king compromises with the Scots.</div>

<p>In the mean time the Scotch sent embassadors
to York, saying to the king that they
were advancing to lay their grievances before
him! They expressed great sorrow and regret
at the victory which they had been compelled
to gain over some forces that had attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
prevent them from getting access to their sovereign.
The king laid this communication before
the lords, and asked their advice what to
do; and also asked them to counsel him how
he should provide funds to keep his army together
until a Parliament could be convened.
The lords advised him to appoint commissioners
to meet the Scotch, and endeavor to compromise
the difficulties; and to send to the city
of London, asking that corporation to lend him
a small sum until Parliament could be assembled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition to Strafford.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Strafford desires to return to Ireland.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's promised protection.</div>

<p>This advice was followed. A temporary
treaty was made with the rebels, although
making a treaty with rebels is perhaps the
most humiliating thing that a hereditary sovereign
is ever compelled to do. The Earl of
Strafford was, however, entirely opposed to
this policy. He urged the king most earnestly
not to give up the contest without a more
decisive struggle. He represented to him the
danger of beginning to yield to the torrent
which he now began to see would overwhelm
them all if it was allowed to have its way.
He tried to persuade the king that the Scots
might yet be driven back, and that it would be
possible to get along without a Parliament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
He dreaded a Parliament. The king, however,
and his other advisers, thought that they must
yield a little to the storm. Strafford then
wanted to be allowed to return to his post in
Ireland, where he thought that he should probably
be safe from the terrible enmity which he
must have known that he had awakened in England,
and which he thought a Parliament
would concentrate and bring upon his devoted
head. But the king would not consent to this.
He assured Strafford that if a Parliament
should assemble, he would take care that they
should not hurt a hair of his head. Unfortunate
monarch! How little he foresaw that
that very Parliament, from whose violence he
thus promised to defend his favorite servant so
completely as to insure him from the slightest
injury, would begin by taking off his favorite's
head, and end with taking off his own!</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Downfall of Strafford and Laud.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opening of the new Parliament.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">T</span>HE Parliament assembled in November,
1640. The king proceeded to London to
meet them. He left Strafford in command of
the army at York. Active hostilities had been
suspended, as a sort of temporary truce had
been concluded with the Scots, to prepare the
way for a final treaty. Strafford had been entirely
opposed to this, being still full of energy
and courage. The king, however, began to
feel alarmed. He went to London to meet the
Parliament which he had summoned, but he
was prepared to meet them in a very different
spirit from that which he had manifested on
former occasions. He even gave up all the external
circumstances of pomp and parade with
which the opening of Parliament had usually
been attended. He had been accustomed to go
to the House of Lords in state, with a numerous
retinue and great parade. Now he was
conveyed from his palace along the river in a
barge, in a quiet and unostentatious manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's speech.</div>

<p>His opening speech, too, was moderate and
conciliatory. In a word, it was pretty evident
to the Commons that the proud and haughty
spirit of their royal master was beginning to
be pretty effectually humbled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attacks on Strafford and Laud.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Speeches against them.</div>

<p>Of course, now, in proportion as the king
should falter, the Commons would grow bold.
The House immediately began to attack Laud
and Strafford in their speeches. It is the theory
of the British Constitution that the king
can do no wrong; whatever criminality at any
time attaches to the acts of his administration,
belongs to his <em>advisers</em>, not to himself. The
speakers condemned, in most decided terms, the
arbitrary and tyrannical course which the government
had pursued during the intermission
of Parliaments, but charged it all, not to the
king, but to Strafford and Laud. Strafford
had been, as they considered, the responsible
person in civil and military affairs, and Laud
in those of the Church. These speeches were
made to try the temper of the House and of the
country, and see whether there was hostility
enough to Laud and Strafford in the House and
in the country, and boldness enough in the expression
of it, to warrant their impeachment.</p>

<p>The attacks thus made in the House against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the two ministers were made very soon. Within
a week after the opening of Parliament, one
of the members, after declaiming a long time
against the encroachments and tyranny of
Archbishop Laud, whose title, according to English
usage, was "his Grace," said he hoped
that, before the year ran round, his grace would
either have more grace or no grace at all;
"for," he added, "our manifold griefs do fill a
mighty and vast circumference, yet in such a
manner that from every part our lines of sorrow
do meet in him, and point at him the center,
from whence our miseries in this Church,
and many of them in the Commonwealth, do
flow." He said, also, that if they must submit
to a pope, he would rather obey one that was
as far off as the Tiber, than to have him come
as near as the Thames.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feelings of hostility.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bill of attainder.</div>

<p>Similar denunciations were made against
Strafford, and they awakened no opposition.
On the contrary, it was found that the feeling
of hostility against both the ministers was so
universal and so strong, that the leaders began
to think seriously of an impeachment on a
charge of high treason. High treason is the
greatest crime known to the English law, and
the punishment for it, especially in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a peer of the realm, is very terrible. This punishment
was generally inflicted by what was
called a bill of attainder, which brought with it
the worst of penalties. It implied the perfect
destruction of the criminal in every sense. He
was to lose his life by having his head cut off
upon a block. His body, according to the strict
letter of the law, was to be mutilated in a manner
too shocking to be here described. His
children were disinherited, and his property all
forfeited. This was considered as the consequence
of the <em>attainting</em> of the blood, which rendered
it corrupt, and incapable of transmitting
an inheritance. In fact, it was the intention of
the bill of attainder to brand the wretched object
of it with complete and perpetual infamy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mode of proceeding.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The trial.</div>

<p>The proceedings, too, in the impeachment
and trial of a high minister of state, were always
very imposing and solemn. The impeachment
must be moved by the Commons,
and tried by the Peers. A peer of the realm
could be tried by no inferior tribunal. When
the Commons proposed bringing articles of impeachment
against an officer of state, they sent
first a messenger to the House of Peers to ask
them to arrest the person whom they intended
to accuse, and to hold him for trial until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
should have their articles prepared. The House
of Peers would comply with this request, and a
time would be appointed for the trial. The
Commons would frame the charges, and appoint
a certain number of their members to
manage the prosecution. They would collect
evidence, and get every thing ready for the
trial. When the time arrived, the chamber of
the House of Peers would be arranged as a
court room, or they would assemble in some
other hall more suitable for the purpose, the
prisoner would be brought to the bar, the commissioners
on the part of the Commons would
appear with their documents and their evidence,
persons of distinction would assemble to
listen to the proceedings, and the trial would
go on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings against Strafford.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Arrest of Strafford.</div>

<p>It was in accordance with this routine that
the Commons commenced proceedings against
the Earl of Strafford, very soon after the opening
of the session, by appointing a committee
to inquire whether there was any just cause to
accuse him of treason. The committee reported
to the House that there was just cause. The
House then appointed a messenger to go to the
House of Lords, saying that they had found
that there was just cause to accuse the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Strafford of high treason, and to ask that they
would sequester him from the House, as the
phrase was, and hold him in custody till they
could prepare the charges and the evidence
against him. All these proceedings were in secret
session, in order that Strafford might not
get warning and fly. The Commons then
nearly all accompanied their messenger to the
House of Lords, to show how much in earnest
they were. The Lords complied with the request.
They caused the earl to be arrested and
committed to the charge of the <em>usher of the
black rod</em>, and sent two officers to the Commons
to inform them that they had done so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Usher of the black rod.</div>

<p>The usher of the black rod is a very important
officer of the House of Lords. He is a sort
of sheriff, to execute the various behests of the
House, having officers to serve under him for
this purpose. The badge of his office has been,
for centuries, a black rod with a golden lion at
the upper end, which is borne before him as
the emblem of his authority. A peer of the
realm, when charged with treason, is committed
to the custody of this officer. In this case he
took the Earl of Strafford under his charge, and
kept him at his house, properly guarded. The
Commons went on preparing the articles of impeachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1641.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Laud threatened with violence.</div>

<p>This was in November. During the winter
following the parties struggled one against another,
Laud doing all in his power to strengthen
the position of the king, and to avert the
dangers which threatened himself and Strafford.
The animosity, however, which was felt against
him, was steadily increasing. The House of
Commons did many things to discountenance
the rites and usages of the Episcopal Church,
and to make them odious. The excitement
among the populace increased, and mobs began
to interfere with the service in some of the
churches in London and Westminster. At
last a mob of five hundred persons assembled
around the archbishop's palace at Lambeth.<a name="fnanchor_5_5" id="fnanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#fnanchor_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
This palace, as has been before stated, is on
the bank of the Thames, just above London, opposite
to Westminster. The mob were there for
two hours, beating at the doors and windows in
an attempt to force admission, but in vain.
The palace was very strongly guarded, and the
mob were at length repulsed. One of the ringleaders
was taken and hanged.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="footnote_5_5" id="footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#fnanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> See view of this palace on page 133.
</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Arrest of Laud on the charge of treason.</div>

<p>One would have thought that this sort of
persecution would have awakened some sympathy
in the archbishop's favor; but it was too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>late. He had been bearing down so mercilessly
himself upon the people of England for so
many years, suppressing, by the severest measures,
all expressions of discontent, that the
hatred had become entirely uncontrollable. Its
breaking out at one point only promoted its
breaking out in another. The House of Commons
sent a messenger to the House of Lords,
as they had done in the case of Strafford, saying
that they had found good cause to accuse
the Archbishop of Canterbury of treason, and
asked that he might be sequestered from the
House, and held in custody till they could prepare
their charges, and the evidence to sustain
them.</p>

<p>The archbishop was at that time in his seat.
He was directed to withdraw. Before leaving
the chamber he asked leave to say a few words.
Permission was granted, and he said in substance
that he was truly sorry to have awakened
in the hearts of his countrymen such a degree
of displeasure as was obviously excited
against him. He was most unhappy to have
lived to see the day in which he was made
subject to a charge of treason. He begged
their lordships to look at the whole course of
his life, and he was sure that they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
convinced that there was not a single member
of the House of Commons who could really
think him guilty of such a charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laud's speech.</div>

<p>Here one of the lords interrupted him to say,
that by speaking in that manner he was uttering
slander against the House of Commons,
charging them with solemnly bringing accusations
which they did not believe to be true.
The archbishop then said, that if the charge
must be entertained, he hoped that he should
have a fair trial, according to the ancient Parliamentary
usages of the realm. Another of
the lords interrupted him again, saying that
such a remark was improper, as it was not for
him to prescribe the manner in which the proceedings
should be conducted. He then withdrew,
while the House should consider what
course to take. Presently he was summoned
back to the bar of the House, and there committed
to the charge of the usher of the black
rod. The usher conducted him to his house,
and he was kept there for ten weeks in close
confinement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His confinement.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Trial of Strafford.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Unjust conduct of the Commons.</div>

<p>At last the time for the trial of Strafford
came on, while Laud was in confinement. The
interest felt in the trial was deep and universal.
There were three kingdoms, as it were, combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
against one man. Various measures
were resorted to by the Commons to diminish
the possibility that the accused should escape
conviction. Some of them have since been
thought to be unjust and cruel. For example,
several persons who were strong friends of
Strafford, and who, as was supposed, might offer
testimony in his favor, were charged with
treason and confined in prison until the trial
was over. The Commons appointed thirteen
persons to manage the prosecution. These persons
were many months preparing the charges
and the evidence, keeping their whole proceedings
profoundly secret during all the time. At
last the day approached, and Westminster Hall
was fitted up and prepared to be the scene of
the trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangements at Westminster Hall.</div>

<p>Westminster Hall has the name of being the
largest room whose roof is not supported by
pillars in Europe. It stands in the region of
the palaces and the Houses of Parliament at
Westminster, and has been for seven centuries
the scene of pageants and ceremonies without
number. It is said that ten thousand persons

<p>This great room was fitted up for the trial.
Seats were provided for both houses of Parliament;
for the Commons were to be present as
accusers, and the Lords as the court. There
was, as usual, a chair of state, or throne, for the
king, as a matter of form. There was also a
private gallery, screened from the observation
of the spectators, where the king and queen
could sit and witness the proceedings. They
attended during the whole trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charges.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Imposing Scene.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Strafford's able and eloquent defense.</div>

<p>One would have supposed that the deliberate
solemnity of these preparations would have
calmed the animosity of Strafford's enemies,
and led them to be satisfied at last with something
less than his utter destruction. But this
seems not to have been the effect. The terrible
hostilities which had been gathering strength
so long, seemed to rage all the more fiercely
now that there was a prospect of their gratification.
And yet it was very hard to find any
thing sufficiently distinct and tangible against
the accused to warrant his conviction. The
commissioners who had been appointed to manage
the case divided the charges among them.
When the trial commenced, they stated and
urged these charges in succession. Strafford,
who had not known beforehand what they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to be, replied to them, one by one, with calmness
and composure, and yet with great eloquence
and power. The extraordinary abilities
which he had shown through the whole
course of his life, seemed to shine out with increased
splendor amid the awful solemnities
which were now darkening its close. He was
firm and undaunted, and yet respectful and
submissive. The natural excitements of the
occasion; the imposing assembly; the breathless
attention; the magnificent hall; the consciousness
that the opposition which he was
struggling to stem before that great tribunal
was the combined hostility of three kingdoms,
and that the torrent was flowing from a reservoir
which had been accumulating for many
years; and that the whole civilized world were
looking on with great interest to watch the result;
and perhaps, more than all, that he was
in the unseen presence of his sovereign, whom
he was accustomed to look upon as the greatest
personage on earth; these, and the other
circumstances of the scene, filled his mind with
strong emotions, and gave animation, and energy,
and a lofty eloquence to all that he said.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The charge of treason a mere pretext.</div>

<p>The trial lasted eighteen days, the excitement
increasing constantly to the end. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
was nothing proved which could with any propriety
be considered as treason. He had managed
the government, it is true, with one set
of views in respect to the absolute prerogatives
and powers of the king, while those who now
were in possession of power held opposite views,
and they considered it a matter of necessity
that he should die. The charge of treason was
a pretext to bring the case somewhat within
the reach of the formalities of law. It is one
of the necessary incidents of all governmental
systems founded on force, and not on the consent
of the governed, that when great and fundamental
questions of policy arise, they often
bring the country to a crisis in which there can
be no real settlement of the dispute without the
absolute destruction of one party or the other.
It was so now, as the popular leaders supposed.
They had determined that stern necessity required
that Laud and Strafford must die; and
the only object of going through the formality
of a trial was to soften the violence of the proceeding
a little, by doing all that could be done
toward establishing a legal justification of the
deed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vote on the bill of attainder.</div>

<p>The trial, as has been said, lasted eighteen
days. During all this time, the leaders were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
not content with simply urging the proceedings
forward energetically in Westminster Hall.
They were maneuvering and managing in every
possible way to secure the final vote. But,
notwithstanding this, Strafford's defense was so
able, and the failure to make out the charge
of treason against him was so clear, that it was
doubtful what the result would be. Accordingly,
without waiting for the decision of the Peers
on the impeachment, a bill of attainder against
the earl was brought forward in the House of
Commons. This bill of attainder was passed
by a large majority&mdash;yeas 204, nays 59. It
was then sent to the House of Lords. The
Lords were very unwilling to pass it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interposition of the king.</div>

<p>While they were debating it, the king sent
a message to them to say that in his opinion
the earl had not been guilty of treason, or of
any attempt to subvert the laws; and that
several things which had been alleged in the
trial, and on which the bill of attainder chiefly
rested, were not true. He was willing, however,
if it would satisfy the enemies of the earl,
to have him convicted of a misdemeanor, and
made incapable of holding any public office from
that time; but he protested against his being
punished by a bill of attainder on a charge of
treason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Clamor of the populace.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Condemnation.</div>

<p>This interposition of the king in Strafford's
favor awakened loud expressions of displeasure.
They called it an interference with the
action of one of the houses of Parliament. The
enemies of Strafford created a great excitement
against him out of doors. They raised clamorous
calls for his execution among the populace.
The people made black lists of the names of
persons who were in the earl's favor, and posted
them up in public places, calling such persons
Straffordians, and threatening them with
public vengeance. The Lords, who would
have been willing to have saved Strafford's life
if they had dared, began to find that they could
not do so without endangering their own.
When at last the vote came to be taken in the
House of Lords, out of eighty members who
had been present at the trial, only forty-six
were present to vote, and the bill was passed
by a vote of thirty-five to eleven. The thirty-four
who were absent were probably all against
the bill, but were afraid to appear.</p>

<p>The responsibility now devolved upon the
king. An act of Parliament must be signed by
the king. He really enacts it. The action of
the two houses is, in theory, only a recommendation
of the measure to him. The king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was determined on no account to give his consent
to Strafford's condemnation. He, however,
laid the subject before his Privy Council.
They, after deliberating upon it, recommended
that he should sign the bill. Nothing else,
they said, could allay the terrible storm which
was raging, and the king ought to prefer the
peace and safety of the realm to the life of
any one man, however innocent he might be.
The populace, in the mean time, crowded
around the king's palace at Whitehall, calling
out "<em>Justice! justice!</em>" and filling the air
with threats and imprecations; and preachers
in their pulpits urged the necessity of punishing
offenders, and descanted on the iniquity
which those magistrates committed who allowed
great transgressors to escape the penalty
due for their crimes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king hesitates about signing the bill.</div>

<p>The queen, too, was alarmed. She begged
the king, with tears, not any longer to attempt
to withstand the torrent which threatened to
sweep them all away in its fury. While things
were in this state, Charles received a letter
from Strafford in the Tower, expressing his consent,
and even his request, that the king should
yield and sign the bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tower.</div>

<p>The Tower of London is very celebrated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
English history. Though called simply by the
name of the Tower, it is, in fact, as will be
seen by the engraving in the frontispiece, an
extended group of buildings, which are of all
ages, sizes, and shapes, and covering an extensive
area. It is situated below the city of London,
having been originally built as a fortification
for the defense of the city. Its use for this
purpose has, however, long since passed away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strafford's letter to the king.</div>

<p>Strafford said, in his letter to the king,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To set your Majesty's conscience at Liberty,
I do most humbly beseech your Majesty for
Prevention of Evils, which may happen by
your Refusal, to pass this Bill. Sir, My Consent
shall more acquit you herein to God, than
all the World can do besides; To a willing Man
there is no Injury done; and as by God's Grace,
I forgive all the World, with a calmness and
Meekness of infinite Contentment to my dislodging
Soul, so, Sir, to you I can give the Life
of this World with all the cheerfulness imaginable,
in the just Acknowledgment of your exceeding
Favors; and only beg that in your
Goodness you would vouchsafe to cast your
gracious Regard upon my poor Son and his
three sisters, less or more, and no otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>than as their unfortunate Father may hereafter
appear more or less guilty of this Death.
God long preserve your Majesty."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The king signs the bill.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Strafford's surprise.</div>

<p>On receiving this letter the king caused the
bill to be signed. He would not do it with his
own hands, but commissioned two of his council
to do it in his name. He then sent a messenger
to Strafford to announce the decision,
and to inform him that he must prepare to die.
The messenger observed that the earl seemed
surprised; and after hearing that the king had
signed the bill, he quoted, in a tone of despair,
the words of Scripture, "Put not your trust in
princes, nor in the sons of men, for in them is
no salvation." Historians have thought it
strange that Strafford should have expressed
this disappointment when he had himself requested
the king to resist the popular will no
longer; and they infer from it that he was not
sincere in the request, but supposed that the
king would regard it as an act of nobleness and
generosity on his part, that would render him
more unwilling than ever to consent to his destruction,
and that he was accordingly surprised
and disappointed when he found that the
king had taken him at his word. It is said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
however, by some historians, that this letter
was a forgery, and that it was written by some
of Strafford's enemies to lead the king to resist
no longer. The reader, by perusing the letter
again, can perhaps form some judgment
whether such a document was more likely to
have been fabricated by enemies, or really written
by the unhappy prisoner himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king asks mercy for Strafford.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mercy refused.</div>

<p>The king did not entirely give up the hope
of saving his friend, even after the bill of attainder
was signed. He addressed the following
message to the House of Lords.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My Lords,&mdash;I did yesterday satisfy the Justice
of this Kingdom by passing the Bill of Attainder
against the Earl of Strafford: but Mercy
being as inherent and inseparable to a King
as Justice, I desire at this time in some measure
to shew that likewise, by suffering that
unfortunate Man to fulfill the natural course
of his Life in a close Imprisonment: yet so, if
ever he make the least Offer to escape, or offer
directly or indirectly to meddle in any sort of
public Business, especially with Me either by
Message or Letter, it shall cost him his Life
without farther Process. This, if it may be
done without the Discontentment of my People,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>will be an unspeakable Contentment to
me.</p>

<p>"I will not say that your complying with
me in this my intended Mercy, shall make me
more willing, but certainly 'twill make me
more cheerful in granting your just Grievances:
But if no less than his Life can satisfie my
People, I must say Let justice be done. Thus
again recommending the consideration of my
Intention to you, I rest,</p>

<p>"Your Unalterable and Affectionate Friend,</p>
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span>"</p>

<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Strafford and Laud.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Strafford's message to Laud.</div>

<p>The Lords were inexorable. Three days
from the time of signing the bill, arrangements
were made for conducting the prisoner to the
scaffold. Laud, who had been his friend and
fellow-laborer in the king's service, was confined
also in the Tower, awaiting his turn to come to
trial. They were not allowed to visit each
other, but Strafford sent word to Laud requesting
him to be at his window at the time when
he was to pass, to bid him farewell, and to give
him his blessing. Laud accordingly appeared
at the window, and Strafford, as he passed,
asked for the prelate's prayers and for his blessing.
The old man, for Laud was now nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>seventy years of age, attempted to speak, but
he could not command himself sufficiently to
express what he wished to say, and he fell back
into the arms of his attendants. "God protect
you," said Strafford, and walked calmly on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composure of Strafford.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His execution.</div>

<p>He went to the place of execution with the
composure and courage of a hero. He spoke
freely to those around him, asserted his innocence,
sent messages to his absent friends, and
said he was ready and willing to die. The
scaffold, in such executions as this, is a platform
slightly raised, with a block and chairs upon it,
all covered with black cloth. A part of the
dress has to be removed just before the execution,
in order that the neck of the sufferer may
be fully exposed to the impending blow. Strafford
made these preparations himself, and said,
as he did so, that he was in no wise afraid of
death, but that he should lay his head upon that
block as cheerfully as he ever did upon his pillow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Execution of Laud.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His firmness.</div>

<p>Charles found his position in no respect improved
by the execution of Strafford. The
Commons, finding their influence and power increasing,
grew more and more bold, and were
from this time so absorbed in the events connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
with the progress of their quarrel with
the king, that they left Laud to pine in his
prison for about four years. They then found
time to act over again the solemn and awful
scene of a trial for treason before the House of
Peers, the passing of a bill of attainder, and an
execution on Tower Hill. Laud was over
seventy years of age when the ax fell upon him.
He submitted to his fate with a calmness and
heroism in keeping with his age and his character.
He said, in fact, that none of his enemies
could be more desirous to send him out of
life than he was to go.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Civil War.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing demands of the Commons.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">T</span>HE way in which the king came at last
to a final rupture with Parliament was
this. The victory which the Commons gained
in the case of Strafford had greatly increased
their confidence and their power, and the king
found, for some months afterward, that instead
of being satisfied with the concessions he had
made, they were continually demanding more.
The more he yielded, the more they encroached.
They grew, in a word, bolder and bolder, in
proportion to their success. They considered
themselves doing the state a great and good
service by disarming tyranny of its power.
The king, on the other hand, considered them
as undermining all the foundations of good
government, and as depriving him of personal
rights, the most sacred and solemn that could
vest in any human being.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king gradually loses his power.</div>

<p>It will be recollected that on former occasions,
when the king had got into contention
with a Parliament, he had dissolved it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
either attempted to govern without one, or else
had called for a new election, hoping that the
new members would be more compliant. But
he could not dissolve the Parliament now.
They had provided against this danger. At
the time of the trial of Strafford, they brought
in a bill into the Commons providing that
thenceforth the Houses could not be prorogued
or dissolved without their own consent. The
Commons, of course, passed the bill very readily.
The Peers were more reluctant, but they
did not dare to reject it. The king was extremely
unwilling to sign the bill; but, amid
the terrible excitements and dangers of that
trial, he was overborne by the influences of danger
and intimidation which surrounded him.
He signed the bill. Of course the Commons
were, thereafter, their own masters. However
dangerous or destructive the king might consider
their course of conduct to be, he could now
no longer arrest it, as heretofore, by a dissolution.</p>

<p>He went on, therefore, till the close of 1641,
yielding slowly and reluctantly, and with many
struggles, but still all the time yielding, to the
resistless current which bore him along. At
last he resolved to yield no longer. After retreating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
so long, he determined suddenly and
desperately to face about and attack his enemies.
The whole world looked on with astonishment
at such a sudden change of his policy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king determines to change his policy.</div>

<p>The measure which he resorted to was this.
He determined to select a number of the most
efficient and prominent men in Parliament,
who had been leaders in the proceedings against
him, and demand their arrest, imprisonment,
and trial, on a charge of high treason. The
king was influenced to do this partly by the advice
of the queen, and of the ladies of the court,
and other persons who did not understand how
deep and strong the torrent was which they
thus urged him to attempt to stem. They
thought that if he would show a little courage
and energy in facing these men, they would
yield in their turn, and that their boldness and
success was owing, in a great measure, to the
king's want of spirit in resisting them. "Strike
boldly at them," said they; "seize the leaders;
have them tried, and condemned, and executed.
Threaten the rest with the same fate; and follow
up these measures with energetic and decisive
action, and you will soon make a change
in the aspect of affairs."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1642.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king sends his officers to the House.</div>

<p>The king adopted this policy, and he did
make a change in the aspect of affairs, but not
such a change as his advisers had anticipated.
The Commons were thrown suddenly into a
state of astonishment one day by the appearance
of a king's officer in the House, who rose
and read articles of a charge of treason against
five of the most influential and popular members.
The officer asked that a committee
should be appointed to hear the evidence
against them which the king was preparing.
The Commons, on hearing this, immediately
voted, that if any person should attempt even
to seize the papers of the persons accused, it
should be lawful for them to resist such an attempt
by every means in their power.</p>

<p>The next day another officer appeared at the
bar of the House of Commons, and spoke as follows.
"I am commanded by the king's majesty,
my master, upon my allegiance, that I
should come to the House of Commons, and require
of Mr. Speaker five gentlemen, members
of the House of Commons; and those gentlemen
being delivered, I am commanded to arrest
them in his majesty's name, on a charge
of high treason." The Commons, on hearing
this demand, voted that they would take it into
consideration!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king goes to the House himself.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's speech in the House.</div>

<p>The king's friends and advisers urged him to
follow the matter up vigorously. Every thing
depended, they said, on firmness and decision.
The next day, accordingly, the king determined
to go himself to the House, and make the demand
in person. A lady of the court, who was
made acquainted with this plan, sent notice of
it to the House. In going, the king took his
guard with him, and several personal attendants.
The number of soldiers was said to be
five hundred. He left this great retinue at the
door, and he himself entered the House. The
Commons, when they heard that he was coming,
had ordered the five members who were
accused to withdraw. They went out just before
the king came in. The king advanced to
the speaker's chair, took his seat, and made the
following address.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Gentlemen,&mdash;I am sorry for this occasion
of coming unto you. Yesterday I sent a Sergeant-at-Arms
upon a very important occasion
to apprehend some that by my Command were
accused of High Treason; whereunto I did expect
Obedience and not a message. And I
must declare unto you here, that albeit no king
that ever was in England shall be more careful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>of your Privileges, to maintain them to the uttermost
of his Power, than I shall be; yet you
must know that in cases of Treason no Person
hath a Privilege; and therefore I am come to
know if any of those Persons that were accused
are here. For I must tell you, Gentlemen,
that so long as these Persons that I have accused
(for no slight Crime, but for Treason) are
here, I can not expect that this House will be
in the right way that I do heartily wish it.
Therefore I am come to tell you that I must
have them wherever I find them."</p></div>

<p>After looking around, and finding that the
members in question were not in the hall, he
continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Well! since I see the Birds are flown, I
do expect from you that you shall send them
unto me as soon as they return hither. But I
assure you, on the Word of a King, I never did
intend any Force, but shall proceed against
them in a legal and fair way, for I never meant
any other.</p>

<p>"I will trouble you no more, but tell you I
do expect, as soon as they come to the House,
you will send them to me, otherwise I must
take my own course to find them."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Great excitement in the House.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The speaker's reply.</div>

<p>The king's coming thus into the House of
Commons, and demanding in person that they
should act according to his instructions, was a
very extraordinary circumstance&mdash;perhaps unparalleled
in English history. It produced the
greatest excitement. When he had finished
his address, he turned to the speaker and asked
him where those men were. He had his guard
ready at the door to seize them. It is difficult
for us, in this country, to understand fully to
how severe a test this sudden question put the
presence of mind and courage of the speaker;
for we can not realize the profound and awful
deference which was felt in those days for the
command of a king. The speaker gained great
applause for the manner in which he stood the
trial. He fell upon his knees before the great
potentate who had addressed him, and said, "I
have, sir, neither eyes to see, nor tongue to
speak, in this place, but as the House is pleased
to direct me, whose servant I am. And I
humbly ask pardon that I can not give any
other answer to what your majesty is pleased
to demand of me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of the king's rashness.</div>

<p>The House was immediately in a state of
great excitement and confusion. They called
out "<em>Privilege! privilege!</em>" meaning that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
their privileges were violated. They immediately
adjourned. News of the affair spread
every where with the greatest rapidity, and
produced universal and intense excitement.
The king's friends were astonished at such an
act of rashness and folly, which, it is said, only
<em>one</em> of the king's advisers knew any thing about,
and he immediately fled. The five members
accused went that night into the city of London,
and called on the government and people
of London to protect them. The people armed
themselves. In a word, the king found at
night that he had raised a very threatening and
terrible storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Committee of the Commons.</div>

<p>The Commons met the next morning, but
did not attempt to transact business. They
simply voted that it was useless for them to
proceed with their deliberations, while exposed
to such violations of their rights. They appointed
a committee of twenty-four to inquire
into and report the circumstances of the king's
intrusion into their councils, and to consider
how this breach of their privileges could be repaired.
They ordered this committee to sit in
the city of London, where they might hope to
be safe from such interruptions, and then the
House adjourned for a week, to await the result
of the committee's deliberations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The committee went to London. In the
mean time, news went all over the kingdom
that the House of Commons had been compelled
to suspend its sittings on account of an illegal
and unwarrantable interference with their
proceedings on the part of the king. The king
was alarmed; but those who had advised him
to adopt this measure told him that he must
not falter now. He must persevere and carry
his point, or all would be lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king goes to London.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cries of the people.</div>

<p>He accordingly did persevere. He brought
troops and arms to his palace at Whitehall, to
be ready to defend it in case of attack. He
sent in to London, and ordered the lord mayor
to assemble the city authorities at the Guildhall,
which is the great city hall of London;
and then, with a retinue of noblemen, he went
in to meet them. The people shouted, "<em>Privileges
of Parliament! privileges of Parliament!</em>"
as he passed along. Some called out,
"<em>To your tents, O Israel!</em>" which was the ancient
Hebrew cry of rebellion. The king, however,
persevered. When he reached the Guildhall,
he addressed the city authorities thus:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen,&mdash;I am come to demand such
Persons as I have already accused of High
Treason, and do believe are shrouded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
City. I hope no good Man will keep them from
Me. Their Offenses are Treason and Misdemeanors
of a high Nature. I desire your Assistance,
that they may be brought to a legal
Trial." Three days after this the king issued
a proclamation, addressed to all magistrates and
officers of justice every where, to arrest the accused
members and carry them to the Tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations to escort the committee to Westminster.</div>

<p>In the mean time, the committee of twenty-four
continued their session in London, examining
witnesses and preparing their report.
When the time arrived for the House of Commons
to meet again, which was on the 11th of
January, the city made preparations to have
the committee escorted in an imposing manner
from the Guildhall to Westminster. A vast
amount of the intercommunication and traffic
between different portions of the city then, as
now, took place upon the river, though in those
days it was managed by watermen, who rowed
small wherries to and fro. Innumerable steamboats
take the place of the wherries at the
present day, and stokers and engineers have
superseded the watermen. The watermen
were then, however, a large and formidable
body, banded together, like the other trades of
London, in one great organization. This great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
company turned out on this occasion, and attended
the committee in barges on the river,
while the military companies of the city marched
along the streets upon the land. The committee
themselves went in barges on the water,
and all London flocked to see the spectacle.
The king, hearing of these arrangements, was
alarmed for his personal safety, and left his
palace at Whitehall to go to Hampton Court,
which was a little way out of town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Report of the committee.</div>

<p>The committee, after entering the House,
reported that the transactions which they had
been considering constituted a high breach of
the privileges of the House, and was a seditious
act, tending to a subversion of the peace of the
kingdom; and that the privileges of Parliament,
so violated and broken, could not be sufficiently
vindicated, unless his majesty would be
pleased to inform them who advised him to do
such a deed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alarm of the king.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king yields.</div>

<p>The king was more and more seriously
alarmed. He found that the storm of public
odium and indignation was too great for him to
withstand. He began to fear for his own safety
more than ever. He removed from Hampton
Court to Windsor Castle, a stronger place,
and more remote from London than Hampton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Court; and he now determined to give up the
contest. He sent a message, therefore, to the
House, saying that, on further reflection, since
so many persons had doubts whether his proceedings
against the five members were consistent
with the privileges of Parliament, he
would waive them, and the whole subject might
rest until the minds of men were more composed,
and then, if he proceeded against the accused
members at all, he would do so in a manner
to which no exception could be taken. He
said, also, he would henceforth be as careful of
their privileges as he should be of his own life
or crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing excitement.</div>

<p>Thus he acknowledged himself vanquished
in the struggle, but the acknowledgment came
too late to save him. The excitement increased,
and spread in every direction. The party of
the king and that of the Parliament disputed
for a few months about these occurrences, and
others growing out of them, and then each began
to maneuver and struggle to get possession
of the military power of the kingdom. The
king, finding himself not safe in the vicinity of
London, retreated to York, and began to assemble
and organize his followers. Parliament
sent him a declaration that if he did not disband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the forces which he was assembling, they
should be compelled to provide measures for securing
the peace of the kingdom. The king
replied by proclamations calling upon his subjects
to join his standard. In a word, before
midsummer, the country was plunged in the
horrors of civil war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil war.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its nature.</div>

<p>A civil war, that is, a war between two
parties in the same country, is generally far
more savage and sanguinary than any other.
The hatred and the animosities which it creates,
ramify throughout the country, and produce
universal conflict and misery. If there
were a war between France and England,
there might be one, or perhaps two invading
armies of Frenchmen attempting to penetrate
into the interior. All England would be united
against them. Husbands and wives, parents
and children, neighbors and friends, would
be drawn together more closely than ever;
while the awful scenes of war and bloodshed,
the excitement, the passion, the terror, would
be confined to a few detached spots, or to a few
lines of march which the invading armies had
occupied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cruelties and miseries of civil war.</div>

<p>In a civil war, however, it is very different.
Every distinct portion of the country, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
village and hamlet, and sometimes almost every
family, is divided against itself. The hostility
and hatred, too, between the combatants, is always
far more intense and bitter than that
which is felt against a foreign foe. We might
at first be surprised at this. We might imagine
that where men are contending with their
neighbors and fellow-townsmen, the recollection
of past friendships and good-will, and various
lingering ties of regard, would moderate
the fierceness of their anger, and make them
more considerate and forbearing. But this is
not found to be the case. Each party considers
the other as not only enemies, but traitors,
and accordingly they hate and abhor each other
with a double intensity. If an Englishman
has a <em>Frenchman</em> to combat, he meets him
with a murderous impetuosity, it is true, but
without any special bitterness of animosity.
He <em>expects</em> the Frenchman to be his enemy.
He even thinks he has a sort of natural right
to be so. He will kill him if he can; but then,
if he takes him prisoner, there is nothing in his
feelings toward him to prevent his treating him
with generosity, and even with kindness. He
hates him, but there is a sort of good-nature in
his hatred, after all. On the other hand, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
he fights against his countrymen in a civil war,
he abhors and hates with unmingled bitterness
the traitorous ingratitude which he thinks his
neighbors and friends evince in turning enemies
to their country. He can see no honesty, no
truth, no courage in any thing they do. They
are infinitely worse, in his estimation, than the
most ferocious of foreign foes. Civil war is,
consequently, always the means of far wider
and more terrible mischief than any other human
calamity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taking sides between the king and Parliament.</div>

<p>In the contention between Charles and the
Parliament, the various elements of the social
state adhered to one side or the other, according
to their natural predilections. The Episcopalians
generally joined the king, the Presbyterians
the Parliament. The gentry and the nobility
favored the king; the mechanics, artisans,
merchants, and common people the Parliament.
The rural districts of country, which
were under the control of the great landlords,
the king; the cities and towns, the Parliament.
The gay, and fashionable, and worldly, the
king; the serious-minded and austere, the Parliament.
Thus every thing was divided. The
quarrel ramified to every hamlet and to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
fireside, and the peace and happiness of the
realm were effectually destroyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations for war.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Fruitless negotiations.</div>

<p>Both sides began to raise armies and to prepare
for war. Before commencing hostilities,
however, the king was persuaded by his counselors
to send a messenger to London and propose
some terms of accommodation. He accordingly
sent the Earl of Southampton to the
House of Peers, and two other persons to the
House of Commons. He had no expectation,
probably, of making peace, but he wanted to
gain time to get his army together, and also to
strengthen his cause among the people by showing
a disposition to do all in his power to avoid
open war. The messengers of the king went
to London, and made their appearance in the
two houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>The House of Lords ordered the Earl of
Southampton to withdraw, and to send his communication
in in writing, and in the mean time
to retire out of London, and wait for their answer.
The House of Commons, in the same
spirit of hostility and defiance, ordered the messengers
which had been sent to them to come
to the bar, like humble petitioners or criminals,
and make their communication there.</p>

<p>The propositions of the king to the houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of Parliament were, that they should appoint a
certain number of commissioners, and he also
the same number, to meet and confer together,
in hope of agreeing upon some conditions of
peace. The houses passed a vote in reply, declaring
that they had been doing all in their
power to preserve the peace of the kingdom,
while the king had been interrupting and disturbing
it by his military gatherings, and by
proclamations, in which they were called traitors;
and that they could enter into no treaty
with him until he disbanded the armies which
he had collected, and recalled his proclamations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Messages between the king and Parliament.</div>

<p>To this the king replied that he had never
intended to call them traitors; and that when
they would recall their declarations and votes
stigmatizing those who adhered to him as traitors,
he would recall his proclamations. Thus
messages passed back and forth two or three
times, each party criminating the other, and
neither willing to make the concessions which
the other required. At last all hope of an accommodation
was abandoned, and both sides
prepared for war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1643.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ravages of the war.</div>

<p>The nobility and gentry flocked to the king's
standard. They brought their plate, their jewels,
and their money to provide funds. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of them brought their servants. There were
two companies in the king's guard, one of which
consisted of gentlemen, and the other of their
servants. These two companies were always
kept together. There was the greatest zeal
and enthusiasm among the upper classes to
serve the king, and equal zeal and enthusiasm
among the common people to serve the Parliament.
The war continued for four years.
During all this time the armies marched and
countermarched all over the kingdom, carrying
ruin and destruction wherever they went, and
plunging the whole country in misery.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Hampden.</div>

<p>At one of the battles which was fought, the
celebrated John Hampden, the man who would
not pay his ship money, was slain. He had
been a very energetic and efficient officer on
the Parliamentary side, and was much dreaded
by the forces of the king. At one of the battles
between Prince Rupert, Charles's nephew, and
the army of the Parliament, the prince brought
to the king's camp a large number of prisoners
which he had taken. One of the prisoners said
he was confident that Hampden was hurt, for
he saw him riding off the field before the battle
was over, with his head hanging down, and his
hands clasping the neck of his horse. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>heard the next day that he had been wounded
in the shoulder. Inflammation and fever ensued,
and he died a few days afterward in great
agony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prince Rupert. His knowledge and ingenuity.</div>

<p>This Prince Rupert was a very famous character
in all these wars. He was young and ardent,
and full of courage and enthusiasm. He
was always foremost and ready to embark in
the most daring undertakings. He was the
son of the king's sister Elizabeth, who married
the Elector Palatine, as narrated in a preceding
chapter. He was famous not only for his military
skill and attainments, but for his knowledge
of science, and for his ingenuity in many
philosophical arts. There is a mode of engraving
called mezzotinto, which is somewhat easier
of execution than the common mode, and produces
a peculiar effect. Prince Rupert is said
to have been the inventor of it, though, as is
the case with almost all other inventions, there
is a dispute about it. He discovered a mode
of dropping melted glass into water so as to
form little pear-shaped globules, with a long
slender tail. These globules have this remarkable
property, that if the tip of the tail is broken
off ever so gently, the whole flies into
atoms with an explosion. These drops of glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
are often exhibited at the present day, and are
called Prince Rupert's drops. The prince also
discovered a very tenacious composition of metals
for casting cannon. As artillery is necessarily
very heavy, and very difficult to be transported
on marches and upon the field of battle,
it becomes very important to discover such metallic
compounds as have the greatest strength
and tenacity in resisting the force of an explosion.
Prince Rupert invented such a compound,
which is called by his name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the war.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of making peace.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The women clamor for peace.</div>

<p>There were not only a great many battles
and fierce encounters between the two great
parties in this civil war, but there were also,
at times, temporary cessations of the hostilities,
and negotiations for peace. But it is very
hard to make peace between two powers engaged
in civil war. Each considers the other
as acting the part of rebels and traitors, and
there is a difficulty, almost insuperable, in the
way of even opening negotiations between them.
Still the people became tired of the war. At
one time, when the king had made some propositions
which the Parliament would not accept,
an immense assemblage of women collected together,
with white ribbons in their hats, to go
to the House of Commons with a petition for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
peace. When they reached the door of the hall
their number was five thousand. They called
out, "Peace! peace! Give us those traitors
that are against peace, that we may tear them
to pieces." The guards who were stationed at
the door were ordered to fire at this crowd,
loading their guns, however, only with powder.
This, it was thought, would frighten them
away; but the women only laughed at the
volley, and returned it with stones and brickbats,
and drove the guards away. Other troops
were then sent for, who charged upon the women
with their swords, and cut them in their
faces and hands, and thus at length dispersed
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Queen Henrietta's arrival in England.</div>

<p>During the progress of the war, the queen returned
from the Continent and joined the king.
She had some difficulty, however, and encountered
some personal danger, in her efforts to return
to her husband. The vice-admiral, who
had command of the English ships off the coast,
received orders to intercept her. He watched
for her. She contrived, however, to elude his
vigilance, though there were four ships in her
convoy. She landed at a town called Burlington,
or Bridlington, in Yorkshire. This town
stands in a very picturesque situation, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
south of a famous promontory called Flamborough
Head, of which there is a beautiful
view from the pier of the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The vice-admiral cannonades the queen.</div>

<p>The queen succeeded in landing here. On
her arrival at the town, she found herself
worn down with the anxiety and fatigue of the
voyage, and she wanted to stop a few days to
rest. She took up her residence in a house
which was on the quay, and, of course, near
the water. The quay, as it is called, in these
towns, is a street on the margin of the water,
with a wall, but no houses next the sea. The
vice-admiral arrived at the town the second
night after the queen had landed. He was
vexed that his expected prize had escaped him.
He brought his ships up near to the town, and
began to fire toward the house in which the
queen was lodging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p228.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="304" />
<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">The Landing of the Queen.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This was at five o'clock in the morning.
The queen and her attendants were in their
beds, asleep. The reports of the cannon from
the ships, the terrific whistling of the balls
through the air, and the crash of the houses
which the balls struck, aroused the whole village
from their slumbers, and threw them into
consternation. The people soon came to the
house where the queen was lodging, and begged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>her to fly. They said that the neighboring
houses were blown to pieces, and that her own
would soon be destroyed, and she herself would
be killed. They may, however, have been influenced
more by a regard to their own safety
than to hers in these injunctions, as it must
have been a great object with the villagers to
effect the immediate removal of a visitor who
was the means of bringing upon them so terrible
a danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The queen's danger.</div>

<p>These urgent entreaties of the villagers were
soon enforced by two cannon-balls, which fell,
one after another, upon the roof of the house,
and, crashing their way through the roof and
the floors, went down, without seeming to regard
the resistance, from the top to the bottom.
The queen hastily put on her clothes, and went
forth with her attendants on foot, the balls
from the ships whistling after them all the way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">She seeks shelter in a trench.</div>

<p>One of her servants was killed. The rest of
the fugitives, finding their exposure so great,
stopped at a sort of trench which they came
to, at the end of a field, such as is dug commonly,
in England, on one side of the hedge,
to make the barrier more impassable to the animals
which it is intended to confine. This
trench, with the embankment formed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
earth thrown out of it, on which the hedge is
usually planted, afforded them protection. They
sought shelter in it, and remained there for two
hours, like besiegers in the approaches to a
town, the balls passing over their heads harmlessly,
though sometimes covering them with
the earth which they threw up as they bounded
by. At length the tide began to ebb, and
the vice-admiral was in danger of being left
aground. He weighed his anchors and withdrew,
and the queen and her party were relieved.
Such a cannonading of a helpless and
defenseless woman is a barbarity which could
hardly take place except in a civil war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The queen joins her husband.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Her influence.</div>

<p>The queen rejoined her husband, and she
rendered him essential service in many ways.
She had personal influence enough to raise both
money and men for his armies, and so contributed
very essentially to the strength of his
party. At last she returned to the Continent
again, and went to Paris, where she was still
actively employed in promoting his cause. At
one of the battles in which the king was defeated,
the Parliamentary army seized his baggage,
and found among his papers his correspondence
with the queen. They very ungenerously
ordered it to be published, as the letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
seemed to show a vigorous determination
on the part of the king not to yield in the contest
without obtaining from the Parliament
and their adherents full and ample concessions
to his claims.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1646.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The royal cause declines.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Prince of Wales.</div>

<p>As time rolled on, the strength of the royal
party gradually wasted away, while that of
Parliament seemed to increase, until it became
evident that the latter would, in the end, obtain
the victory. The king retreated from
place to place, followed by his foes, and growing
weaker and more discouraged after every
conflict. His son, the Prince of Wales, was
then about fifteen years of age. He sent him
to the western part of the island, with directions
that, if affairs should still go against him,
the boy should be taken in time out of the
country, and join his mother in Paris. The
danger grew more and more imminent, and
they who had charge of the young prince sent
him first to Scilly, and then to Jersey&mdash;islands
in the Channel&mdash;whence he made his escape to
Paris, and joined his mother. Fifteen years
afterward he returned to London with great
pomp and parade, and was placed upon the
throne by universal acclamation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hopeless condition of the king.</div>

<p>At last the king himself, after being driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
from one place of refuge to another, retreated
to Oxford and intrenched himself there. Here
he spent the winter of 1646 in extreme depression
and distress. His friends deserted him;
his resources were expended; his hopes were
extinguished. He sent proposals of peace to
the Parliament, and offered, himself, to come
to London, if they would grant him a safe-conduct.
In reply, they <em>forbade</em> him to come.
They would listen to no propositions, and would
make no terms. The case, they saw, was in
their own hands, and they determined on unconditional
submission. They hemmed the
king in on all sides at his retreat in Oxford,
and reduced him to despair.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Scots, a year or two
before this, had raised an army and crossed the
northern frontier, and entered England. They
were against monarchy and Episcopacy, but
they were, in some respects, a separate enemy
from those against whom the king had been
contending so long; and he began to think
that he had perhaps better fall into their hands
than into those of his English foes, if he must
submit to one or to the other. He hesitated
for some time what course to take; but at last,
after receiving representations of the favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
feeling which prevailed in regard to him in the
Scottish army, he concluded to make his escape
from Oxford and surrender himself to
them. He accordingly did so, and the civil
war was ended.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">T</span>HE circumstances of King Charles's surrender
to the Scots were these. He knew
that he was surrounded by his enemies in Oxford,
and that they would not allow him to escape
if they could prevent it. He and his
friends, therefore, formed the following plan to
elude them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's escape from Hampton Court.</div>

<p>They sent word to the commanders of each
of the several gates of the city, on a certain
day, that during the ensuing night three men
would have to pass out on business of the
king's, and that when the men should appear
and give a certain signal, they were to be allowed
to pass. The officer at each gate received
this command without knowing that a similar
one had been sent to the others.</p>

<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Newark.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, about midnight, the parties of
men were dispatched, and they went out at the
several gates. The king himself was in one of
these parties. There were two other persons
with him. One of these persons was a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>Mr. Ashburnham, and the king was disguised
as his servant. They were all on horseback,
and the king had a valise upon the horse behind
him, so as to complete his disguise. This
was on the 27th of April. The next day, or
very soon after, it was known at Oxford that
his majesty was gone, but no one could tell in
what direction, for there was no means even of
deciding by which of the gates he had left the
city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king delivers himself to the Scots.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His reception.</div>

<p>The Scotch were, at this time, encamped before
the town of Newark, which is on the Trent,
in the heart of England, and about one hundred
and twenty miles north of London. There
was a magnificent castle at Newark in those
days, which made the place very strong. The
town held out for the king; for, though they had
been investing it for some time, they had not
yet succeeded in compelling the governor to
surrender. The king concluded to proceed to
Newark and enter the Scottish camp. He considered
it, or, rather, tried to have it considered,
that he was coming to join them as their monarch.
<em>They</em> were going to consider it surrendering
to them as their prisoner. The king himself
must have known how it would be, but it
made his sense of humiliation a little less poignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to carry this illusion with him as long as
it was possible to maintain it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proclamation by Parliament.</div>

<p>As soon as the Parliament found that the
king had made his escape from Oxford, they
were alarmed, and on the 4th of May they issued
an order to this effect, "That what person
soever should harbor and conceal, or should
know of the harboring or concealing of the
king's person, and should not immediately reveal
it to the speakers of both houses, should be
proceeded against as a traitor to the Commonwealth,
and die without mercy." The proclamation
of this order, however, did not result
in arresting the flight of the king. On the day
after it was issued, he arrived safely at Newark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender of Newark.</div>

<p>The Scottish general, whose name was Lesley,
immediately represented to the king that
for his own safety it was necessary that they
should retire toward the northern frontier; but
they could not so retire, he said, unless Newark
should first surrender. They accordingly induced
the king to send in orders to the governor
of the castle to give up the place. The
Scots took possession of it, and, after having
garrisoned it, moved with their army toward
the north, the king and General Lesley being
in the van.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations about the disposal of the king's person.</div>

<p>They treated the king with great distinction,
but guarded him very closely, and sent word to
the Parliament that he was in their possession.
There ensued long negotiations and much debate.
The question was, at first, whether the
English or Scotch should have the disposal of
the king's person. The English said that <em>they</em>,
and not the Scots, were the party making war
upon him; that they had conquered his armies,
and hemmed him in, and reduced him to the
necessity of submission; and that he had been
taken captive on English soil, and ought, consequently,
to be delivered into the hands of the
English Parliament. The Scots replied that
though he had been taken in England, he was
their king as well as the king of England, and
had made himself their enemy; and that, as he
had fallen into their hands, he ought to remain
at their disposal. To this the English rejoined,
that the Scots, in taking him, had not acted on
their own account, but as the allies, and, as it
were, the agents of the English, and that they
ought to consider the king as a captive taken
for them, and hold him subject to their disposal.</p>

<p>They could not settle the question. In the
mean time the Scottish army drew back toward
the frontier, taking the king with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scots surrender the king.</div>

<p>About this time a negotiation sprung up between
the Parliament and the Scots for the payment
of the expenses which the Scottish army
had incurred in their campaign. The Scots
sent in an account amounting to two millions
of pounds. The English objected to a great
many of the charges, and offered them two
hundred thousand pounds. Finally it was settled
that four hundred thousand pounds should
be paid. This arrangement was made early in
September. In January the Scots agreed to
give up the king into the hands of the English
Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether he was sold.</div>

<p>The world accused the Scots of selling their
king to his enemies for four hundred thousand
pounds. The Scots denied that there was any
connection between the two transactions above
referred to. They received the money on account
of their just claims; and they afterward
agreed to deliver up the king, because they
thought it right and proper so to do. The
friends of the king, however, were never satisfied
that there was not a secret understanding
between the parties, that the money paid was
not the price of the king's delivery; and as
this delivery resulted in his death, they called
it the price of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's amusements in captivity.</div>

<p>Charles was at Newcastle when they came
to this decision. His mind had been more at
ease since his surrender to the Scots, and he
was accustomed to amuse himself and while
away the time of his captivity by various
games. He was playing chess when the intelligence
was brought to him that he was to be
delivered up to the English Parliament. It
was communicated to him in a letter. He
read it, and then went on with his game, and
none of those around him could perceive by his
air and manner that the intelligence which the
letter contained was any thing extraordinary.
Perhaps he was not aware of the magnitude of
the change in his condition and prospects which
the communication announced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Holmby House.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Contest about forms.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Intolerance.</div>

<p>There was at this time, at a town called Holmby
or Holdenby, in Northamptonshire, a beautiful
palace which was known by the name of
Holmby House. King Charles's mother had purchased
this palace for him when he was the Duke
of York, in the early part of his life, while his father,
King James, was on the throne, and his
older brother was the heir-apparent. It was a
very stately and beautiful edifice. The house
was fitted up in a very handsome manner, and
all suitable accommodations provided for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
king's reception. He had many attendants, and
every desirable convenience and luxury of living;
but, though the war was over, there was
still kept up between the king and his enemies a
petty contest about forms and punctilios, which
resulted from the spirit of intolerance which characterized
the age. The king wanted his own
Episcopal chaplains. The Parliament would
not consent to this, but sent him two Presbyterian
chaplains. The king would not allow
them to say grace at the table, but performed
this duty himself; and on the Sabbath, when
they preached in his chapel, he never would attend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scotch preacher.</div>

<p>One singular instance of this sort of bigotry,
and of the king's presence of mind under the
action of it, took place while the king was at
Newcastle. They took him one day, to the
chapel in the castle to hear a Scotch Presbyterian
who was preaching to the garrison.
The Scotchman preached a long discourse
pointed expressly at the king. Those preachers
prided themselves on the fearlessness with
which, on such occasions, they discharged what
they called their duty. To cap the climax of
his faithfulness, the preacher gave out, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
close of the sermon, the hymn, thus: "We will
sing the fifty-first Psalm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">"'Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself,<br /></div>
 <div class="indent4">Thy wicked works to praise?'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's presence of mind.</div>

<p>As the congregation were about to commence
the singing, the king cast his eye along
the page, and found in the fifty-sixth hymn one
which he thought would be more appropriate.
He rose, and said, in a very audible manner,
"We will sing the fifty-<em>sixth</em> Psalm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">"'Have mercy, Lord, on me I pray,<br /></div>
 <div class="indent4">For men would me devour.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The congregation, moved by a sudden impulse
of religious generosity extremely unusual
in those days, immediately sang the psalm
which the king had chosen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king receives letters from the queen.</div>

<p>While he was at Holmby the king used
sometimes to go, escorted by a guard, to certain
neighboring villages where there were
bowling-greens. One day, while he was going
on one of these excursions, a man, in the dress
of a laborer, appeared standing on a bridge as
he passed, and handed him a packet. The
commissioners who had charge of Charles&mdash;for
some of them always attended him on these excursions&mdash;seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the man. The packet was
from the queen. The king told the commissioners
that the letter was only to ask him
some question about the disposal of his son, the
young prince, who was then with her in Paris.
They seemed satisfied, but they sent the disguised
messenger to London, and the Parliament
committed him to prison, and sent down
word to dismiss all Charles's own attendants,
and to keep him thenceforth in more strict confinement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The army.</div>

<p>In the mean time, the Parliament, having
finished the war, were ready to disband the
army. But the army did not want to be disbanded.
They would not be disbanded. The
officers knew very well that if their troops were
dismissed, and they were to return to their
homes as private citizens, all their importance
would be gone. There followed long debates
and negotiations between the army and the
Parliament, which ended, at last, in an open
rupture. It is almost always so at the end of
a revolution. The military power is found to
have become too strong for the civil institutions
of the country to control it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1647.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Oliver Cromwell.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His plan to seize the king.</div>

<p>Oliver Cromwell, who afterward became so
distinguished in the days of the Commonwealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was at this time becoming the most influential
leader of the army. He was not the commander-in-chief
in form, but he was the great planner
and manager in fact. He was a man of
great sternness and energy of character, and
was always ready for the most prompt and daring
action. He conceived the design of seizing
the king's person at Holmby, so as to take him
away from the control of the Parliament, and
transfer him to that of the army. This plan
was executed on the 4th of June, about two
months after the king had been taken to Holmby
House. The abduction was effected in the
following manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cornet Joyce.</div>

<p>Cromwell detached a strong party of choice
troops, under the command of an officer by the
name of Joyce, to carry the plan into effect.
These troops were all horsemen, so that their
movements could be made with the greatest
celerity. They arrived at Holmby House at
midnight. The cornet, for that was the military
title by which Joyce was designated, drew
up his horsemen about the palace, and demanded
entrance. Before his company arrived, however,
there had been an alarm that they were
coming, and the guards had been doubled.
The officers in command asked the cornet what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
was his name and business. He replied that
he was Cornet Joyce, and that his business
was to speak to the king. They asked him by
whom he was sent, and he replied that he was
sent by <em>himself</em>, and that he must and would
see the king. They then commanded their
soldiers to stand by their arms, and be ready to
fire when the word should be given. They,
however, perceived that Joyce and his force
were a detachment from the army to which
they themselves belonged, and concluding to
receive them as brothers, they opened the gates
and let them in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He forces admittance to the king.</div>

<p>The cornet stationed sentinels at the doors
of those apartments of the castle which were
occupied by the Scotch commissioners who had
the king in charge, and then went himself directly
to the king's chamber. He had a pistol
loaded and cocked in his hand. He knocked
at the door. There were four grooms in waiting:
they rebuked him for making such a disturbance
at that time of the night, and told
him that he should wait until the morning if
he had any communication to make to the
king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joyce's interview with the king.</div>

<p>The cornet would not accede to this proposition,
but knocked violently at the door, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
servants being deterred from interfering by
dread of the loaded pistol, and by the air and
manner of their visitor, which told them very
plainly that he was not to be trifled with.
The king finally heard the disturbance, and,
on learning the cause, sent out word that Joyce
must go away and wait till morning, for he
would not get up to see him at that hour.
The cornet, as one of the historians of the time
expresses it, "huffed and retired." The next
morning he had an interview with the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His "instructions."</div>

<p>When he was introduced to the king's apartment
in the morning, the king said that he
wished to have the Scotch commissioners present
at the interview. Joyce replied that the
commissioners had nothing to do now but to return
to the Parliament at London. The king
then said that he wished to see his instructions.
The cornet replied that he would show them to
him, and he sent out to order his horsemen to
parade in the inner court of the palace, where
the king could see them from his windows;
and then, pointing them out to the king, he
said, "These, sir, are my instructions." The
king, who, in all the trials and troubles of his
life of excitement and danger, took every thing
quietly and calmly, looked at the men attentively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>They were fine troops, well mounted
and armed. He then turned to the cornet, and
said, with a smile, that "his instructions were
in fair characters, and could be read without
spelling." The cornet then said that his orders
were to take the king away with him. The
king declined going, unless the commissioners
went too. The cornet made no objection, saying
that the commissioners might do as they
pleased about accompanying him, but that he
himself must go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king taken to Cambridge.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Closely guarded.</div>

<p>The party set off from Holmby and traveled
two days, stopping at night at the houses of
friends to their cause. They reached Cambridge,
where the leading officers of the army
received the king, rendering him every possible
mark of deference and respect. From Cambridge
he was conducted by the leaders of the
army from town to town, remaining sometimes
several days at a place. He was attended by
a strong guard, and was treated every where
with the utmost consideration and honor. He
was allowed some little liberty, in riding out
and in amusements, but every precaution was
taken to prevent the possibility of an escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's evil.</div>

<p>The people collected every where into the
places through which he had to pass, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
presence-chamber was constantly thronged.
This was not altogether on account of their
respect and veneration for him as king, but
it arose partly from a very singular cause.
There is a certain disease called the scrofula,
which in former times had the name of the
King's Evil. It is a very unmanageable and
obstinate disorder, resisting all ordinary modes
of treatment; but in the days of King Charles,
it was universally believed by the common people
of England, that if a <em>king</em> touched a patient
afflicted with this disease, he would recover.
This was the reason why it was called the
king's evil. It was the evil that kings only
could cure. Now, as kings seldom traveled
much about their dominions, whenever one did
make such a journey, the people embraced the
opportunity to bring all the cases which could
possibly be considered as scrofula to the line of
his route, in order that he might touch the persons
afflicted and heal them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king removed to Hampton Court.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's interview with his children.</div>

<p>In the course of the summer the king was
conducted to Hampton Court, a beautiful palace
on the Thames, a short distance above London.
Here he remained for some time. He
had an interview here with two of his children.
The oldest son was still in France. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
whom he saw here were the Duke of Gloucester
and the Princess Elizabeth. He found that
they were under the care of a nobleman of high
rank, and that they were treated with great
consideration. Charles was extremely gratified
and pleased with seeing these members of
his family again, after so long a separation.
His feelings of domestic affection were very
strong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contentions.</div>

<p>The king remained at Hampton Court two
or three months. During this time, London,
and all the region about it, was kept in a continual
state of excitement by the contentions
of the army and Parliament, and the endless
negotiations which they attempted with each
other and with the king. During all this time
the king was in a sort of elegant and honorable
imprisonment in his palace at Hampton
Court; but he found the restraints to which he
was subjected, and the harassing cares which
the contests between these two great powers
brought upon him, so great, that he determined
to make his escape from the thraldom which
bound him. He very probably thought that he
could again raise his standard, and collect an
army to fight in his cause. Or perhaps he
thought of making his escape from the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
altogether. It is not improbable that he was
not decided himself which of these plans to
pursue, but left the question to be determined
by the circumstances in which he should find
himself when he had regained his freedom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's escape from Hampton Court.</div>

<p>At any rate, he made his escape. One evening,
about ten o'clock, attendants came into his
room at Hampton Court, and found that he had
gone. There were some letters upon the table
which he had left, directed to the Parliament,
to the general of the army, and to the officer
who had guarded him at Hampton Court.
The king had left the palace an hour or two before.
He passed out at a private door, which
admitted him to a park connected with the palace.
He went through the park by a walk
which led down to the water, where there was
a boat ready for him. He crossed the river in
the boat, and on the opposite shore he found
several officers and some horses ready to receive
him. He mounted one of the horses, and the
party rode rapidly away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1648.</div>

<p>They traveled all night, and arrived, toward
morning, at the residence of a countess on
whose attachment to him and fidelity he placed
great reliance. The countess concealed him in
her house, though it was understood by all concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that this was only a temporary place of
refuge. He could not long be concealed here,
and her residence was not provided with any
means of defense; so that, immediately on
their arrival at the countess's, the king and the
few friends who were with him began to concert
plans for a more secure retreat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carisbrooke Castle.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel Hammond.</div>

<p>The house of the countess was on the southern
coast of England, near the Isle of Wight.
There was a famous castle in those days upon
this island, near the center of it, called Carisbrooke
Castle. The ruins of it, which are very
extensive, still remain. This castle was under
the charge of Colonel Hammond, who was at
that time governor of the island. Colonel
Hammond was a near relative of one of King
Charles's chaplains, and the king thought it
probable that he would espouse his cause. He
accordingly sent two of the gentlemen who had
accompanied him to the Isle of Wight to see
Colonel Hammond, and inquire of him whether
he would receive and protect the king if he
would come to him. But he charged them not
to let Hammond know where he was, unless
he would first solemnly promise to protect him,
and not to subject him to any restraint.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king again a prisoner.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His confinement in Carisbrooke Castle.</div>

<p>The messengers went, and, to the king's surprise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>brought back Hammond with them. The
king asked them whether they had got his written
promise to protect him. They answered
no, but that they could depend upon him as a
man of honor. The king was alarmed. "Then
you have betrayed me," said he, "and I am his
prisoner." The messengers were then, in their
turn, alarmed at having thus disappointed and
displeased the king, and they offered to kill
Hammond on the spot, and to provide some
other means of securing the king's safety. The
king, however, would not sanction any such
proceeding, but put himself under Hammond's
charge, and was conveyed to Carisbrooke Castle.
He was received with every mark of respect,
but was very carefully guarded. It was
about the middle of November that these events
took place.</p>

<p>Hammond notified the Parliament that
King Charles was in his hands, and sent for
directions from them as to what he should do.
Parliament required that he should be carefully
guarded, and they appropriated £5000
for the expenses of his support. The king
remained in this confinement more than a
year, while the Parliament and the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
were struggling for the mastery of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's employments.</div>

<p>He spent his time, during this long period,
in various pursuits calculated to beguile the
weary days, and he sometimes planned schemes
for escape. There were also a great many
messages and negotiations going between the
king and the Parliament, which resulted in
nothing but to make the breach between them
wider and wider. Sometimes the king was
silent and depressed. At other times he seemed
in his usual spirits. He read serious books
a great deal, and wrote. There is a famous
book, which was found in manuscript after his
death among his papers, in his handwriting,
which it is supposed he wrote at this time.
He was allowed to take walks upon the castle
wall, which was very extensive, and he had
some other amusements which served to occupy
his leisure time. He found his confinement,
however, in spite of all these mitigations,
wearisome and hard to bear.</p>

<p>There were some schemes attempted to enable
him to regain his liberty. There was one
very desperate attempt. It seems that Hammond,
suspecting that the king was plotting
an escape, dismissed the king's own servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and put others in their places&mdash;persons in whom
he supposed he could more implicitly rely.
One of these men, whose name was Burley,
was exasperated at being thus dismissed. He
went through the town of Carisbrooke, beating
a drum, and calling upon the people to rise
and rescue their sovereign from his captivity.
The governor of the castle, hearing of this, sent
out a small body of men, arrested Burley, and
hanged and quartered him. The king was
made a close prisoner immediately after this
attempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unsuccessful attempts to escape.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Osborne.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding this, another attempt was
soon made by the king himself, which came
much nearer succeeding. There was a man
by the name of Osborne, whom Hammond employed
as a personal attendant upon the king.
He was what was called gentleman usher.
The king succeeded in gaining this person's favor
so much by his affability and his general
demeanor, that one day he put a little paper
into one of the king's gloves, which it was a
part of his office to hold on certain occasions,
and on this paper he had written that he was
at the king's service. At first Charles was
afraid that this offer was only a treacherous
one; but at length he confided in him. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
mean time, there was a certain man by the
name of Rolf in the garrison, who conceived
the design of enticing the king away from the
castle on the promise of promoting his escape,
and then murdering him. Rolf thought that
this plan would please the Parliament, and that
he himself, and those who should aid him in
the enterprise, would be rewarded. He proposed
this scheme to Osborne, and asked him
to join in the execution of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plan of escape.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rolf's treacherous design.</div>

<p>Osborne made the whole plan known to the
king. The king, on reflection, said to Osborne,
"Very well; continue in communication with
Rolf, and help him mature his plan. Let him
thus aid in getting me out of the castle, and
we will make such arrangements as to prevent
the assassination." Osborne did so. He
also gained over some other soldiers who were
employed as sentinels near the place of escape.
Osborne and Rolf furnished the king with a
saw and a file, by means of which he sawed off
some iron bars which guarded one of his windows.
They were then, on a certain night, to
be ready with a few attendants on the outside
to receive the king as he descended, and convey

<div class="sidenote">Rolf foiled.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king made a closer prisoner.</div>

<p>In the mean time, Rolf and Osborne had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
each obtained a number of confederates, those
of the former supposing that the plan was to
assassinate the king, while those of the latter
understood that the plan was to assist him in
escaping from captivity. Some expressions
which were dropped by one of this latter class
alarmed Rolf, and led him to suspect some
treachery. He accordingly took the precaution
to provide a number of armed men, and to
have them ready at the window, so that he
should be sure to be strong enough to secure
the king immediately on his descent from the
window. When the time came for the escape,
the king, before getting out, looked below, and,
seeing so many armed men, knew at once that
Rolf had discovered their designs, and refused
to descend. He quickly returned to his bed.
The next day the bars were found filed in two,
and the king was made a closer prisoner than
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's wretched condition.</div>

<p>Some months after this, some commissioners
from Parliament went to see the king, and they
found him in a most wretched condition. His
beard was grown, his dress was neglected, his
health was gone, his hair was gray, and, though
only forty-eight years of age, he appeared as
decrepit and infirm as a man of seventy. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
fact, he was in a state of misery and despair.
Even the enemies who came to visit him,
though usually stern and hard-hearted enough
to withstand any impressions, were extremely
affected at the sight.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XI.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Trial and Death.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king removed to Hurst Castle.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cap">A</span>S soon as the army party, with Oliver
Cromwell at their head, had obtained
complete ascendency, they took immediate
measures for proceeding vigorously against the
king. They seized him at Carisbrooke Castle,
and took him to Hurst Castle, which was a
gloomy fortress in the neighborhood of Carisbrooke.
Hurst Castle was in a very extraordinary
situation. There is a long point extending
from the main land toward the Isle of
Wight, opposite to the eastern end of it. This
point is very narrow, but is nearly two miles
long. The castle was built at the extremity.
It consisted of one great round tower, defended
by walls and bastions. It stood lonely and desolate,
surrounded by the sea, except the long
and narrow neck which connected it with the
distant shore. Of course, though comfortless
and solitary, it was a place of much greater security
than Carisbrooke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its extraordinary situation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Another plan of escape.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Objections.</div>

<p>The circumstance of the king's removal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
this new place of confinement were as follows:
In some of his many negotiations with
the Parliament while at Carisbrooke, he had
bound himself, on certain conditions, not to attempt
to escape from that place. His friends,
however, when they heard that the army were
coming again to take him away, concluded
that he ought to lose no time in making his
escape out of the country. They proposed the
plan to the king. He made two objections to
it. He thought, in the first place, that the attempt
would be very likely to fail; and that, if
it did fail, it would exasperate his enemies, and
make his confinement more rigorous, and his
probable danger more imminent than ever.
He said that, in the second place, he had promised
the Parliament that he would not attempt
to escape, and that he could not break his word.</p>

<p>The three friends were silent when they
heard the king speak these words. After a
pause, the leader of them, Colonel Cook, said,
"Suppose I were to tell your majesty that the
army have a plan for seizing you immediately,
and that they will be upon you very soon unless
you escape. Suppose I tell you that we
have made all the preparations necessary&mdash;that
we have horses all ready here, concealed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
pent-house&mdash;that we have a vessel at the Cows<a name="fnanchor_7_7" id="fnanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#fnanchor_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
waiting for us&mdash;that we are all prepared to attend
you, and eager to engage in the enterprise&mdash;the
darkness of the night favoring our
plan, and rendering it almost certain of success.
Now," added he, "these suppositions express
the real state of the case, and the only question
is what your majesty will resolve to do."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#fnanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>There were two points or headlands, on opposite sides of an
inlet from the sea, on the northern side of the Isle of Wight, which
in ancient times received the name of <em>Cows</em>. They were called the
East Cow and the West Cow. The harbor between them formed a safe and
excellent harbor. The name is now spelled Cowes, and the port is, at
the present day, of great commercial importance.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's perplexity.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He refuses to break his word.</div>

<p>The king paused. He was distressed with
perplexity and doubt. At length he said,
"They have promised <em>me</em>, and I have promised
<em>them</em>, and I will not break the promise first."
"Your majesty means by <em>they</em> and <em>them</em>, the
Parliament, I suppose?" "Yes, I do." "But
the scene is now changed. The Parliament
have no longer any power to protect you. The
danger is imminent, and the circumstances absolve
your majesty from all obligation."</p>

<p>But the king could not be moved. He said,
come what may, he would not do any thing
that looked like a breaking of his word. He
would dismiss the subject and go to bed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>enjoy his rest as long as he could. His friends
told him that they feared it would not be long.
They seemed very much agitated and distressed.
The king asked them why they were so
much troubled. They said it was to think of
the extreme danger in which his majesty was
lying, and his unwillingness to do any thing to
avert it. The king replied, that if the danger
were tenfold more than it was, he would not
break his word to avert it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distress of the king's friends.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He is removed from Carisbrooke Castle.</div>

<p>The fears of the king's friends were soon realized.
The next morning, at break of day, he
was awakened by a loud knocking at his door.
He sent one of his attendants to inquire what
it meant. It was a party of soldiers come to
take him away. They would give him no information
in respect to their plans, but required
him to dress himself immediately and go with
them. They mounted horses at the gate of the
castle. The king was very earnest to have his
friends accompany him. They allowed one of
them, the Duke of Richmond, to go with him
a little way, and then told him he must return.
The duke bade his master a very sad and sorrowful
farewell, and left him to go on alone.</p>

<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Ruins of Carisbrooke Castle.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangements for the king's trial.</div>

<p>The escort which were conducting him took
him to Hurst Castle. The Parliament passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>a vote condemning this proceeding, but it was
too late. The army concentrated their forces
about London, took possession of the avenues
to the houses of Parliament, and excluded all
those members who were opposed to them.
The remnant of the Parliament which was
left immediately took measures for bringing
the king to trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arbitrary measures of the Commons.</div>

<p>The House of Commons did not dare to trust
the trial of the king to the Peers, according to
the provisions of the English Constitution, and
so they passed an ordinance for attainting him
of high treason, and for appointing <em>commissioners</em>,
themselves, to try him. Of course, in appointing
these commissioners, they would name
such men as they were sure would be predisposed
to condemn him. The Peers rejected
this ordinance, and adjourned for nearly a fortnight,
hoping thus to arrest any further proceedings.
The Commons immediately voted
that the action of the Peers was not necessary,
and that they would go forward themselves.
They then appointed the commissioners, and ordered
the trial to proceed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king brought to London.</div>

<p>Every thing connected with the trial was
conducted with great state and parade. The
number of commissioners constituting the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
was one hundred and thirty-three, though only
a little more than half that number attended
the trial. The king had been removed from
Hurst Castle to Windsor Castle, and he was
now brought into the city, and lodged in a
house near to Westminster Hall, so as to be at
hand. On the appointed day the court assembled;
the vast hall and all the avenues to it
were thronged. The whole civilized world
looked on, in fact, in astonishment at the almost
unprecedented spectacle of a king tried
for his life by an assembly of his subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roll of commissioners.</div>

<p>The first business after the opening of the
court was to call the roll of the commissioners,
that each one might answer to his name. The
name of the general of the army, Fairfax, who
was one of the number, was the second upon
the list. When his name was called there was
no answer. It was called again. A voice from
one of the galleries replied, "He has too much
wit to be here." This produced some disorder,
and the officers called out to know who answered
in that manner, but there was no reply.
Afterward, when the impeachment was read,
the phrase occurred, "Of all the people of England,"
when the same voice rejoined, "No,
not the half of them." The officers then ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
a soldier to fire into the seat from which
these interruptions came. This command was
not obeyed, but they found, on investigating
the case, that the person who had answered
thus was Fairfax's wife, and they immediately
removed her from the hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king brought into court.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His firmness.</div>

<p>When the court was fully organized, they
commanded the sergeant-at-arms to bring in the
prisoner. The king was accordingly brought
in, and conducted to a chair covered with crimson
velvet, which had been placed for him at
the bar. The judges remained in their seats,
with their heads covered, while he entered, and
the king took his seat, keeping his head covered
too. He took a calm and deliberate survey
of the scene, looking around upon the judges,
and upon the armed guards by which he was
environed, with a stern and unchanging countenance.
At length silence was proclaimed,
and the president rose to introduce the proceedings.</p>

<p>He addressed the king. He said that the
Commons of England, deeply sensible of the
calamities which had been brought upon England
by the civil war, and of the innocent
blood which had been shed, and convinced that
he, the king, had been the guilty cause of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
were now determined to make inquisition for
this blood, and to bring him to trial and judgment;
that they had, for this purpose, organized
this court, and that he should now hear the
charge brought against him, which they would
proceed to try.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The charge.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king interrupts its reading.</div>

<p>An officer then arose to read the charge.
The king made a gesture for him to be silent.
He, however, persisted in his reading, although
the king once or twice attempted to interrupt
him. The president, too, ordered him to proceed.
The charge recited the evils and calamities
which had resulted from the war, and concluded
by saying that "the said Charles Stuart
is and has been the occasioner, author, and
continuer of the said unnatural, cruel, and
bloody wars, and is therein guilty of all the
treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils,
desolations, damages, and mischiefs to this nation
acted and committed in the said wars, or
occasioned thereby."</p>

<p>The president then sharply rebuked the king
for his interruptions to the proceedings, and
asked him what answer he had to make to the
impeachment. The king replied by demanding
by what authority they pretended to call
him to account for his conduct. He told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that he was their king, and they his subjects;
that they were not even the Parliament, and
that they had no authority from any true Parliament
to sit as a court to try him; that he
would not betray his own dignity and rights by
making any answer at all to any charges they
might bring against him, for that would be an
acknowledgment of their authority; but he was
convinced that there was not one of them who
did not in his heart believe that he was wholly
innocent of the charges which they had brought
against him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king objects to the jurisdiction of the court.</div>

<p>These proceedings occupied the first day.
The king was then sent back to his place of
confinement, and the court adjourned. The
next day, when called upon to plead to the impeachment,
the king only insisted the more
strenuously in denying the authority of the
court, and in stating his reasons for so denying
it. The court were determined not to hear
what he had to say on this point, and the president
continually interrupted him; while he,
in his turn, continually interrupted the president
too. It was a struggle and a dispute, not
a trial. At last, on the fourth day, something
like testimony was produced to prove that the
king had been in arms against the forces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Parliament. On the fifth and sixth days, the
judges sat in private to come to their decision;
and on the day following, which was Saturday,
January 27th, they called the king again before
them, and opened the doors to admit the
great assembly of spectators, that the decision
might be announced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sentence of death pronounced against the king.</div>

<p>There followed another scene of mutual interruptions
and disorder. The king insisted on
longer delay. He had not said what he wished
to say in his defense. The president told him
it was now too late; that he had consumed the
time allotted to him in making objections to
the jurisdiction of the court, and now it was
too late for his defense. The clerk then read
the sentence, which ended thus: "For all
which treasons and crimes this court doth adjudge
that he, the said Charles Stuart, is a tyrant,
traitor, murderer, and public enemy, and
shall be put to death by the severing of his
head from his body." When the clerk had
finished the reading, the president rose, and
said deliberately and solemnly,</p>

<p>"The sentence now read and published is
the act, sentence, judgment, and resolution of
the whole court."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tumult.</div>

<p>And the whole court rose to express their assent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
The king then said to the president, "Will
you hear me a word, sir?"</p>

<p><em>President.</em> "Sir, you are not to be heard
after the sentence."</p>

<p><em>King.</em> "Am I not, sir?"</p>

<p><em>President.</em> "No, sir. Guards, withdraw the
prisoner!"</p>

<p><em>King.</em> "I may speak after sentence by your
favor, sir. Hold&mdash;I say, sir&mdash;by your favor,
sir&mdash;If I am not permitted to speak&mdash;" The
other parts of his broken attempts to speak
were lost in the tumult and noise. He was
taken out of the hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king grossly insulted.</div>

<p>One would have supposed that all who witnessed
these dreadful proceedings, and who now
saw one who had been so lately the sovereign
of a mighty empire standing friendless and
alone on the brink of destruction, would have
relented at last, and would have found their
hearts yielding to emotions of pity. But it
seems not to have been so. The animosities
engendered by political strife are merciless, and
the crowd through which the king had to pass
as he went from the hall scoffed and derided
him. They blew the smoke of their tobacco in
his face, and threw their pipes at him. Some
proceeded to worse indignities than these, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the king bore all with quietness and resignation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's last requests.</div>

<div class="sidenote">They are granted.</div>

<p>The king was sentenced on Saturday. On
the evening of that day he sent a request that
the Bishop of London might be allowed to assist
at his devotions, and that his children
might be permitted to see him before he was to
die. There were two of his children then in
England, his youngest son and a daughter.
The other two sons had escaped to the Continent.
The government granted both these requests.
By asking for the services of an Episcopal
clergyman, Charles signified his firm determination
to adhere to the very last hour of
his life to the religious principles which he had
been struggling for so long. It is somewhat
surprising that the government were willing to
comply with the request.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Devotions of the king.</div>

<p>It was, however, complied with, and Charles
was taken from the palace of Whitehall, which
is in Westminster, to the palace of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James,
not very far distant. He was escorted by a
guard through the streets. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James's
there was a small chapel where the king attended
divine service. The Bishop of London
preached a sermon on the future judgment, in
which he administered comfort to the mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the unhappy prisoner, so far as the sad case allowed
of any comfort, by the thought that all
human judgments would be reviewed, and all
wrong made right at the great day. After the
service the king spent the remainder of the day
in retirement and private devotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He declines seeing his friends.</div>

<p>During the afternoon of the day several of
his most trusty friends among the nobility called
to see him, but he declined to grant them
admission. He said that his time was short
and precious, and that he wished to improve it
to the utmost in preparation for the great
change which awaited him. He hoped, therefore,
that his friends would not be displeased
if he declined seeing any persons besides his
children. It would do no good for them to be
admitted. All that they could do for him now
was to pray for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's interview with his children.</div>

<p>The next day the children were brought to
him in the room where he was confined. The
daughter, who was called the Lady Elizabeth,
was the oldest. He directed her to tell her
brother James, who was the second son, and
now absent with Charles on the Continent, that
he must now, from the time of his father's
death, no longer look upon Charles as merely
his older brother, but as his sovereign, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
obey him as such; and he requested her to
charge them both, from him, to love each other,
and to forgive their father's enemies.</p>

<p>"You will not forget this, my dear child,
will you?" added the king. The Lady Elizabeth
was still very young.</p>

<p>"No," said she, "I will never forget it as
long as I live."</p>

<p>He then charged her with a message to her
mother, the queen, who was also on the Continent.
"Tell her," said he, "that I have loved
her faithfully all my life, and that my tender
regard for her will not cease till I cease to
breathe."</p>

<p>Poor Elizabeth was sadly grieved at this
parting interview. The king tried to comfort
her. "You must not be so afflicted for me,"
he said. "It will be a very glorious death that
I shall die. I die for the laws and liberties of
this land, and for maintaining the Protestant
religion. I have forgiven all my enemies, and
I hope that God will forgive them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parting messages.</div>

<p>The little son was, by title, the Duke of
Gloucester. He took him on his knees, and
said, in substance, "My dear boy, they are
going to cut off your father's head." The
child looked up into his father's face very earnestly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
not comprehending so strange an assertion.</p>

<p>"They are going to cut off my head," repeated
the king, "and perhaps they will want
to make you a king; but you must not be king
as long as your brothers Charles and James
live; for if you do, very likely they will, some
time or other, cut off your head." The child
said, with a very determined air, that then they
should never make him king as long as he lived.
The king then gave his children some other
parting messages for several of his nearest relatives
and friends, and they were taken away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The warrant.</div>

<p>In cases of capital punishment, in England
and America, there must be, after the sentence
is pronounced, written authority to the sheriff,
or other proper officer, to proceed to the execution
of it. This is called the warrant, and is
usually to be signed by the chief magistrate of
the state. In England the sovereign always
signs the warrant of execution; but in the case
of the execution of the sovereign himself, which
was a case entirely unprecedented, the authorities
were at first a little at a loss to know what
to do. The commissioners who had judged the
king concluded finally to sign it themselves.
It was expressed substantially as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At the High Court of Justice for the trying
and judging of Charles Stuart, king of England,
January 29th, 1648:</p>

<p>"Whereas Charles Stuart, king of England,
has been convicted, attainted, and condemned
of high treason, and sentence was pronounced
against him by this court, to be put to death
by the severance of his head from his body, of
which sentence execution yet remaineth to be
done; these are, therefore, now to will and require
you to see the said sentence executed in
the open street before Whitehall, upon the morrow,
being the thirtieth day of this instant
month of January, between the hours of ten in
the morning and five in the afternoon of the
said day, with full effect; and for so doing this
shall be your sufficient warrant."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Warrant signed by the judges.</div>

<p>Fifty-nine of the judges signed this warrant,
and then it was sent to the persons appointed
to carry the sentence into execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king sleeps well.</div>

<p>That night the king slept pretty well for
about four hours, though during the evening
before he could hear in his apartment the noise
of the workmen building the platform, or scaffold
as it was commonly called, on which the
execution was to take place. He awoke, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
long before day. He called to an attendant
who lay by his bedside, and requested him
to get up. "I will rise myself," said he, "for
I have a great work to do to-day." He then
requested that they would furnish him with
the best dress, and an extra supply of under
clothing, because it was a cold morning. He
particularly wished to be well guarded from
the cold, lest it should cause him to shiver, and
they would suppose that he was trembling from
fear.</p>

<p>"I have no fear," said he. "Death is not
terrible to me. I bless God that I am prepared."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reading the service.</div>

<p>The king had made arrangements for divine
service in his room early in the morning, to be
conducted by the Bishop of London. The bishop
came in at the time appointed, and read the
prayers. He also read, in the course of the
service, the twenty-ninth chapter of Matthew,
which narrates the closing scenes of our Saviour's
life. This was, in fact, the regular lesson
for the day, according to the Episcopal ritual,
which assigns certain portions of Scripture
to every day of the year. The king supposed
that the bishop had purposely selected this passage,
and he thanked him for it, as he said it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
seemed to him very appropriate to the occasion.
"May it please your majesty," said the bishop,
"it is the proper lesson for the day." The
king was much affected at learning this fact,
as he considered it a special providence, indicating
that he was prepared to die, and that he
should be sustained in the final agony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summons.</div>

<p>About ten o'clock, Colonel Hacker, who was
the first one named in the warrant of execution
of the three persons to whom the warrant
was addressed, knocked gently at the king's
chamber door. No answer was returned. Presently
he knocked again. The king asked his
attendant to go to the door. He went, and
asked Colonel Hacker why he knocked. He
replied that he wished to see the king.</p>

<p>"Let him come in," said the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king carried to Whitehall.</div>

<p>The officer entered, but with great embarrassment
and trepidation. He felt that he had
a most awful duty to perform. He informed
the king that it was time to proceed to Whitehall,
though he could have some time there for
rest. "Very well," said the king; "go on; I
will follow." The king then took the bishop's
arm, and they went along together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Devotions.</div>

<p>They found, as they issued from the palace
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James into the park through which their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
way lay to Whitehall, that lines of soldiers had
been drawn up. The king, with the bishop on
one side, and the attendant before referred to,
whose name was Herbert, on the other, both
uncovered, walked between these lines of
guards. The king walked on very fast, so that
the others scarcely kept pace with him. When
he arrived at Whitehall he spent some further
time in devotion with the bishop, and then, at
noon, he ate a little bread and drank some light
wine. Soon after this, Colonel Hacker, the officer,
came to the door and let them know that
the hour had arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parting scenes.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's speech.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His composure.</div>

<p>The bishop and Hacker melted into tears as
they bade their master farewell. The king directed
the door to be opened, and requested the
officer to go on, saying that he would follow.
They went through a large hall, called the banqueting
hall, to a window in front, through
which a passage had been made for the king to
his scaffold, which was built up in the street
before the palace. As the king passed out
through the window, he perceived that a vast
throng of spectators had assembled in the
streets to witness the spectacle. He had expected
this, and had intended to address them.
But he found that this was impossible, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
space all around the scaffold was occupied with
troops of horse and bodies of soldiers, so as to
keep the populace at so great a distance that
they could not hear his voice. He, however,
made his speech, addressing it particularly to
one or two persons who were near, knowing
that they would put the substance of it on record,
and thus make it known to all mankind.
There was then some further conversation
about the preparations for the final blow, the
adjustment of the dress, the hair, &amp;c., in which
the king took an active part, with great composure.
He then kneeled down and laid his
head upon the block.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death.</div>

<p>The executioner, who wore a mask that he
might not be known, began to adjust the hair
of the prisoner by putting it up under his cap,
when the king, supposing that he was going to
strike, hastily told him to wait for the sign.
The executioner said that he would. The king
spent a few minutes in prayer, and then
stretched out his hands, which was the sign
which he had arranged to give. The axe descended.
The dissevered head, with the blood
streaming from it, was held up by the assistant
executioner, for the gratification of the vast
crowd which was gazing on the scene. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
said, as he raised it, "Behold the head of a
traitor!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The body taken to Windsor Castle.</div>

<p>The body was placed in a coffin covered with
black velvet, and taken back through the
window into the room from which the monarch
had walked out, in life and health, but a
few moments before. A day or two afterward
it was taken to Windsor Castle upon a hearse
drawn by six horses, and covered with black
velvet. It was there interred in a vault in the
chapel, with an inscription upon lead over the
coffin:</p>

<p class="center">KING CHARLES.<br />

1648.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Commonwealth.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Government in the United States.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ownership.</div>

<p>After the death of Charles, a sort of republic
was established in England, called the Commonwealth,
over which, instead of a king, Oliver
Cromwell presided, under the title of Protector.
The country was, however, in a very
anomalous and unsettled state. It became
more distracted still after the death of the Protector,
and it was only twelve years after beheading
the father that the people of England,
by common consent, called back the son to the
throne. It seems as if there could be no stable
government in a country where any very large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
portion of the inhabitants are destitute of property,
without the aid of that mysterious but all-controlling
principle of the human breast, a
spirit of reverence for the rights, and dread of
the power of an hereditary crown. In the United
States almost every man is the possessor of
property. He has his house, his little farm,
his shop and implements of labor, or something
which is his own, and which he feels would be
jeopardized by revolution and anarchy. He
dreads a general scramble, knowing that he
would probably get less than he would lose by
it. He is willing, therefore, to be governed by
abstract law. There is no need of holding up
before him a scepter or a crown to induce obedience.
He submits without them. He votes
with the rest, and then abides by the decision
of the ballot-box. In other countries, however,
the case is different. If not an actual majority,
there is at least a very large proportion of
the community who possess nothing. They get
scanty daily food for hard and long-continued
daily labor; and as change, no matter what, is
always a blessing to sufferers, or at least is always
looked forward to as such, they are ready
to welcome, at all times, any thing that promises
commotion. A war, a conflagration, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
riot, or a rebellion, is always welcome. They
do not know but that they shall gain some advantage
by it, and in the mean time the excitement
of it is some relief to the dead and eternal
monotony of toil and suffering.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No stable governments result from violent revolutions.</div>

<p>It is true that the revolutions by which monarchies
are overturned are not generally effected,
in the first instance, by this portion of the
community. The throne is usually overturned
at first by a higher class of men; but the
deed being done, the inroad upon the established
course and order of the social state being
once made, this lower mass is aroused and excited
by it, and soon becomes unmanageable.
When property is so distributed among the population
of a state that all have an <em>interest</em> in
the preservation of order, then, and not till then,
will it be safe to give to all a share in the <em>power</em>
necessary for preserving it; and, in the mean
time, revolutions produced by insurrections and
violence will probably only result in establishing
governments unsteady and transient just in
proportion to the suddenness of their origin.</p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
